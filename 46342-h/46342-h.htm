            <td class="c2">1. (<i><a href="#i_001.jpg">Frontispiece</a>.</i>) Great Seals of King Richard C&#339;ur-de-Lion.
The first of these (with the rounded helmet) has been drawn
from impressions appended to Harleian Charters, 43, C. 27;
43, C. 29; and 43, C. 30; and Carlton Ride Seals, i. 19. In
this, as in other cases, more seals have been examined, but it
seems unnecessary to supply references to any but the best
examples. The king wears the hauberk of chain-mail with
continuous coif, over a tunic of unusual length. The
chausses are also of chain-mail, and there is an appearance
of a chausson at the knee, but the prominence of the seal at
this part has caused so much obliteration, that the existence
of this garment may be doubted. The helmet is rounded at
the top, and appears to be strengthened by bands passing
round the brow and over the crown. The shield is bowed,
and the portion in sight ensigned with a Lion: it is armed
with a spike in front, and suspended over the shoulders by
the usual <i>guige</i>. Other points of this figure will be noticed
at a later page.<br/><br />

Second Great Seal of Richard I. Drawn from impressions
in the British Museum: Harl. Charter, 43, C. 31, and Select
Seals, <span class="smcap">xvi.</span> 1; and Carlton Ride Seals, H. 17. The armour,
though differently expressed from that of the first seal, is
probably intended to represent the same fabric; namely, interlinked
chain-mail. The tunic is still of a length which
seems curiously ill-adapted to the adroit movements of a
nimble warrior. The shield of the monarch is one of the
most striking monuments of the Herald's art: the vague
ornament of Richard's earlier shield has given place to the
Three Lions Passant Gardant so familiar to us all in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
royal arms of the present day. The king wears the plain
goad spur, and is armed with the great double-edged sword,
characteristic of the period. The helmet is described at
page <a href="#Page_141">141</a>. The saddle is an excellent example of the War-saddle
of this date.</td>

and breathing. The mailing has been obliterated from the
chausses, if any ever were there. The surcoat is still of great
length. The bowed shield exhibits the usual three Lions.
But a novelty appears in the spurs of this figure, which
are rowelled. No earlier instance of the rowel spur has
been observed, and indeed it seldom appears again during
the whole century. Usually on the alert to adopt any
novelty of military equipment, the knights appear to have
rejected with particular obstinacy the innovation of the
wheeled spur, though to us it appears so strongly recommended
by the greater humanity of its contrivance. Compare

Offas," by Matthew Paris. This group, which occurs on
folio 7 of the manuscript, represents the Mercian king,
Offa I., combating in behalf of the king of Northumberland,
and defeating the Scottish army. The drawings of this
curious volume, all of which have been copied by Strutt in
his <i>Horda</i>, appear to be of the close of the thirteenth

King Offa has the distinction of greaves and knee-pieces:
the mailing of a portion of his coif differs from the
rest of the suits, probably from carelessness of the artist
only. The horse of the king is also discriminated from the
other steeds by having a housing. The head-defence, composed
of a mask of steel placed over the coif of banded-mail,
is very remarkable. In the adjoining figure we again see

the Norman fortress was a massive building surrounded by
a court, the Edwardian arrangement was a court surrounded
by strong buildings. The buildings themselves differed in
many particulars, not only from their Norman predecessors,
but from each other; and it would require a volume to examine
at large the many curious devices for offence and defence

<h5>FROM THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE IRON PERIOD TO THE
ELEVENTH CENTURY.</h5>


<p>By whatever race Europe may have been originally
peopled, this portion of the world seems to have been
swept by successive tribes of adventurers from Central
Asia. The so-called "Allophylian race" was displaced
by the Celts; the Sclaves then drove the Celts to the
west, and the Tshuds into the cold regions of the north;
and lastly, the Teutonic conquerors, dispossessing at will
the nations that had preceded them, laid the foundation
of that vast social empire which at present, in Europe, in
America, in Asia, and in the new world of the South
Seas, rules the destinies of half the globe. For the purposes
of art, the long period of time at which we have so
rapidly glanced has been divided into the Stone Period,
the Bronze Period, and the Iron Period; names derived
from the materials which were in <i>general</i> use during the
progress of the various races towards civilization;&mdash;a
division which, though, from its great comprehensiveness,
necessarily open to some objection, seems likely to be of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
much use in simplifying a study hitherto embarrassing
alike to the general reader, and to those whose task it is
to extend the range of our knowledge.</p>

<p>With the nations of the Stone Period and the Bronze
Period we do not purpose to occupy ourselves; not that
the relics of their times are of an inferior interest, but
that, in commencing with the days of the iron-workers,
which for general purposes we assume to be identical
with the retirement of the Romans beyond the Alps, and
the domination of the northern nations in the centre and
west of Europe, we feel that we have a task before us
already much greater than we can hope to fulfil, either
to the satisfaction of our readers, or our own. If we
leave much undone, we shall endeavour, in that we do,
to be exact. Modern archÃ¦ology differs from the old
antiquarianism especially in this,&mdash;that whatever it contributes
to knowledge is required to be scrupulously true.
A monkish chronicler of the fourteenth century is no
longer held to be an authority for the affairs of the
twelfth; an illuminated Froissart of the fifteenth century
is no more permitted to supply us with portraits of the
Black Prince, or the costume of Duguesclin. Our pictures
are no longer copies of copies; neither are they
mere <i>versions</i> of old art. We must have line for line,
point for point. This is essential, for two reasons: we
are freed from the danger of any wrong interpretation of
an historic fact, and we keep in view the characteristic
art of the period under examination. The importance of
this practice admitted, we shall be excused for stating
that almost all the illustrations of this work have been
drawn by the writer;&mdash;when from manuscripts, the collection
and folio of the volume have been carefully recorded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
so that the truthfulness of the copy may be readily
tested;&mdash;after the drawings had been transferred to the
wood, they were carefully examined before the graver
was permitted to commence its work; and if, in spite
of every precaution, some unlucky error would at last
creep in, the mistake was always rectified with new
engraving.</p>

<p>The chief evidences for the military equipment and
usages of the Teutonic conquerors of Europe, from the
period of the dismemberment of the Roman empire to
the great triumphs achieved by the Normans in the
eleventh century, are the writers of those times, the
miniatures which decorate their works, and the graves
of these ancient races; which last have of late years
yielded a wondrous harvest of valuable memorials, illustrating
as well the domestic practices of their occupants,
as their warlike array. If these three classes of monuments
are useful in supplying each other's deficiencies,
still more valuable do they become to the archÃ¦ologist
and the historian, by the confirmation which they mutually
afford to each other's testimony. A few discrepancies
indeed occasionally appear on points of minute
detail; and it is in the pages of the historians and
chroniclers that these are generally found: but when we
consider the difficulty of the transmission of knowledge
in those days, and the errors that may have crept in
from the negligence of book-copyists through so many
successive generations, the wonder is, not that something
has been left obscure, but that so much has been faithfully
transmitted to our times.</p>

<p>The various sons of Odin, whether settled in Germany,
in Gaul, in Iberia, in Scandinavia, or in Britain, bore a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
strong resemblance to each other, both in their military
equipment, and in such tactics as they possessed. If
we find one branch of this vast family combating the
Romans with more than usual art, or conducting a campaign
with larger strategical views than their fellows,
we must attribute it rather to the superior skill of a particular
leader, or to their having borrowed some valuable
hints from the practice of their opponents, than to any
essential difference between this or that tribe of Teutons,&mdash;between
the dwellers on the right bank of the Rhine
and the dwellers on the left bank,&mdash;between those whose
huts were on the flats of the Waal, and those who had
built their cabins in the valleys of the Loire. Such differences
as have been observed, we shall point out in our
progress; but we are inclined to believe that, as collections
are augmented and comparisons extended, resemblances
will be found to increase, and differences to
diminish.</p>

<p>Among the writers who afford us information on the
early weapons and mode of warfare of that branch of the
Teutonic family which acquired the name of Franks, there
are three whose testimony is of especial value to us; and
we must again remark, that what was particularly true
of the Franks was generally true of the Anglo-Saxons,
and of all the cognate tribes which traversed Europe as
conquerors. These three writers are&mdash;Sidonius Apollinaris,
bishop of Auvergne, who, in the fifth century,
wrote his Panegyric of the Emperor Majorian; Procopius,
the secretary of Belisarius, who lived in the sixth century,
and was an eye-witness of the facts he records;
and Agathias, a Greek historian, who flourished in the
seventh century. "The Franks," says Sidonius, describing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the defeat of their king Clodion by the Roman
general Aetius, "are a tall race, and clad in garments
which fit them closely. A belt (<i>balteus</i>) encircles their
waist. They hurl their axes (<i>bipennes</i>) and cast their
spears (<i>hastas</i>) with great force, never missing their aim.
They manage their shields with much address, and rush
on their enemy with such velocity, that they seem to fly
more rapidly than their javelins (<i>hastas</i>). They accustom
themselves to warfare from their earliest years, and if
overpowered by the multitude of their enemies, they meet
their end without fear. Even in death their features
retain the expression of their indomitable valour:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">'Invicti perstant, animoque supersunt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jam propÃ¨ post animam.'"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Procopius, describing the expedition of the Franks
into Italy in the sixth century, tells us:&mdash;"Among the
hundred thousand men that the king (Theodobert I.)
led into Italy, there were but few horsemen, and these
he kept about his person. This cavalry alone carried
spears (<i>hastas</i>). The remainder were infantry, who had
neither spear nor bow, (<i>non arcu, non hastÃ¢ armati</i>,) all
their arms being a sword, an axe, and a shield. The
blade of the axe was large, its handle of wood, and
very short. At a given signal they march forward;
on approaching the adverse ranks they hurl their axes
against the shields of the enemy, which by this means
are broken; and then, springing on the foe, they complete
his destruction with the sword<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>."</p>

<p>Agathias, in the seventh century, writes:&mdash;"The arms
of the Franks are very rude; they wear neither coat-of-fence
nor greaves, their legs being protected by bands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
linen or leather. They have little cavalry, but their infantry
are skilful and well disciplined. They wear their
swords on the left thigh, and are furnished with shields.
The bow and the sling are not in use among them, but they
carry double axes (&#960;&#949;&#955;&#8051;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#962; &#7936;&#956;&#966;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8057;&#956;&#959;&#965;&#962;,) and barbed
spears (&#7940;&#947;&#947;&#969;&#957;&#945;&#962;.) These spears, which are of a moderate
length, they use either for thrusting or hurling. The
staves of them are armed with iron, so that very little
of the wood remains uncovered<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. The head has two
barbs, projecting downwards as far as the shaft. In
battle, they cast this spear at the enemy, which becomes
so firmly fixed in the flesh by the two barbs, that it
cannot be withdrawn; neither can it be disengaged if it
pierce the shield, for the iron with which the staff is
covered prevents the adversary from ridding himself of
it by means of his sword. At this moment the Frank
rushes forward, places his foot on the shaft of the spear
as it trails upon the ground, and having thus deprived
his foe of his defence, cleaves his skull with his axe,
or transfixes him with a second spear<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>."</p>

<p>We here see that the usual arms of the Franks at this
time were the axe, the sword, the spear, of two kinds,
and the shield. Body-armour is not worn by the
soldiery at large; and the chief device of the assailant
is to deprive his adversary of the aid of his shield, in
order that no obstacle may stand between his brawny
arm and death. The provision of cavalry is small, and
the few horsemen that are found appear rather as a body-guard
to the prince than as an ingredient of the army.
The evidences above quoted are borne out, not alone by
the contents of the Teutonic graves, but by other passages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
of ancient writers. Gregory of Tours, in the sixth century,
tells us that Clovis, reviewing his troops soon
after the battle of Soissons, reprimanded a slovenly
soldier, by telling him, "There is no one here whose
arms are so ill kept as yours: neither your spear
(<i>hasta</i>), nor your sword (<i>gladius</i>), nor your axe (<i>bipennis</i>),
is fit for service<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>." This author adds a new
weapon to the Frankish soldier's equipment, in which
he is equally supported by the evidences from the
graves. They carried also, he tells us, a dagger, which
was worn suspended from the belt. Tacitus, as early
as the second century, describes with great exactness
the spear-javelin named by Agathias. The whole passage
is so curiously illustrative of our subject, that we
venture to quote it:&mdash;"Rari gladiis, aut majoribus lanceis
utuntur, hastas, vel ipsorum vocabulo <i>frameas</i>, gerunt,
angusto et brevi ferro, sed ita acri et ad usum
habili ut eodem telo, prout ratio poscit, vel cominÃ¹s
vel eminÃ¹s pugnent: et eques quidem scuto frameaque
contentus est: pedites et missilia spargunt, pluraque
singuli, atque in immensum vibrant, nudi aut sagulo
leves, nulla cultus jactatio: scuta tantum lectissimis
coloribus distinguunt: paucis loricÃ¦, vix uni alterive
cassis aut galea."&mdash;(<i>Germania.</i>)</p>

<p>In the long and fierce contention between the North
and the South,&mdash;between the rugged Goth and the
polished Roman,&mdash;it could not but happen that an
adroit captain of the ruder host would avail himself of
the greater skill of his adversaries; that every campaign
would teach some new formation, that every battle
would disclose some useful stratagem: weapons would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
improved, enriched, and augmented in their variety; the
defensive armour of the leaders would extend to their
subordinates; while the leaders, to retain their distinction,
would be induced to render their panoply more
splendid and more costly. We find, therefore, in the
poems and chronicles of this later time, constant mention
of rich arms and armour; and in the capitularies
of Charlemagne especially, we get a glimpse of the improvements
in northern warfare. "Let each count,"
commands the emperor, "be careful that the troops he
has to lead to battle are fully equipped; that they have
spear, shield, a bow with two strings, and twelve arrows,
helmet, and coat-of-fence<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>." We here see the soldiery
adding to their defensive appointments the casque and
lorica, and to their offensive arms the bow and arrows.
The equipment of Charlemagne himself has been handed
down to us in the contemporary description of the Monk
of Saint Gall. The head of the monarch was armed
with an iron helmet,&mdash;"his iron breast and his shoulders
of marble were defended by a cuirasse of iron." His
arms and legs were also covered with armour; of which
the cuissards appear to have been composed of the
jazerant-work so much in vogue at a later period:
"coxarum exteriora: in eo ferreis ambiebantur bracteolis<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>."
The followers of the prince, adds his biographer,
were similarly defended, except that they dispensed
with the cuissards, which were inconvenient on horseback.</p>

<p>The proportion of cavalry continued to increase, as we
clearly see from this phrase in a capitulary of <i>Charles le
Chauve</i>:&mdash;"Ut pagenses franci qui caballos habent, aut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
habere possunt, cum suis comitibus in hostem pergant."
By the clause, "aut habere possunt," it appears evident
that some effort was expected to be made in order to
extend this force.</p>

<p>Under Clovis and his immediate successors, (sixth century,)
the Frankish army seems to have been pretty
strictly limited to that race. But later, the Burgundians,
and then the Germans, and at length the Gauls themselves,
were admitted to the service. The troops were
levied in the various provinces, and bore their names; as
the Andegavi, the Biturici, the C&#339;nomanici, the Pictavi.
Their leaders were the king, the dukes, and the counts.
The Church lands were bound to furnish their contingent
of armed men. The exempts were the very young, the
old, the sick<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>, and the newly married for the term of
one year<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. The provinces not only furnished the fighting
men, but their arms, clothing, and a supply of food.
"We order," says another of the capitularies of Charlemagne,
"that, according to <i>ancient custom</i>, each man provide
himself in his province with food for three months,
and with arms and clothing for half a year<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>." It may
be inferred from this order, that the prince trusted, for
the last three months' sustenance of his troops, to the
maxim always so much in favour with conquerors, that
war should be made to maintain war.</p>

<p>In England, the Teutonic adventurers, when by many
a fierce battle they had established a footing, and by the
league of many a tribe they had united themselves into
a large and powerful community, seem to have divided
their society into two classes,&mdash;the Eorl, or noble, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Ceorl, or freeman. "Before the time of Canute," remarks
Mr. Kemble, "the ealdorman, or duke, was the leader of
the <i>posse comitatus</i>, or levy <i>en masse</i>, as well as of his own
followers<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>." The only superior dignities were the king
and archbishop. The subordinate commands were held by
the royal officers, who led the nobles and their retainers;
the bishops' or abbots' officers, who were at the head of
the Church vassals; and the sheriffs, who conducted the
<i>posse comitatus</i><a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>. No distinct intimation of the dress of
the ealdorman has come down to us, but he probably
wore a <i>beÃ¡h</i>, or ring, upon his head, the <i>fetel</i>, or embroidered
belt, and the golden hilt which seems to have
been peculiar to the noble class. The staff and sword
were probably borne by him as symbols of his civil and
criminal jurisdiction<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>. But the new constitution introduced
by Canute reduced the ealdorman to a subordinate
position. Over several counties was now placed
one eorl, or earl, (in the Northern sense, a jarl,) with
power analogous to that of the Frankish dukes. The
king rules by his earls and hÃºscarlas, and the ealdormen
vanish from the counties. Gradually this old title ceases
altogether, except in the cities, where it denotes an
inferior judicature, much as it does among ourselves at
the present day<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>hÃºscarlas</i> were a kind of household troops, variously
estimated at three thousand or six thousand men.
They were formed on the model of the earlier <i>comites</i>,
but probably not organized as a regular force till the
time of Canute. To this prince, living as he was among
a conquered and turbulent people, the maintenance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
such a band, always well armed, and ready for the fray,
was of the first necessity. Their weapons were the
axe, the halbard, and the sword; this last being inlaid
with gold. From the collocation of names among the
witnesses to a charter of the middle of the eleventh
century, we may infer that the <i>stealleras</i>, or marshals,
were the commanding officers of the hÃºscarlas<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. In
imitation of the king, the great nobles surrounded
themselves with a body-guard of hÃºscarlas, and they
continued to exist as a royal establishment after the
Conquest.</p>

<p>Like his ancestors, the ancient Germans, of whom
Tacitus tells us, "nihil neque publicÃ¦ neque privatÃ¦
rei nisi armati agunt," the Anglo-Saxon freeman always
went armed; a circumstance, however, that proves,
not so much the extent of his freedom, as the smallness
of his civilization. The ancient Egyptians, on the contrary,
always went unarmed; and in the <i>Kristendom's
Saga</i> we read, that among the Icelanders, about 1139,
so great was the security, that "men no longer carried
weapons at a public meeting, and that scarcely more
than a single helmet could be seen at a judicial assemblage<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>."</p>

<p>The mode of raising ships among the Anglo-Saxons
we learn from an entry in the Saxon Chronicle under
the year 1008:&mdash;"This year the king commanded that
ships should be speedily built throughout the nation; to
wit: from three hundred hides, and from ten hides, one
vessel; and from eight hides, a helmet and a coat-of-fence."</p>

<p>On especial occasions, the ships of war appear to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
been decorated in a very costly manner; as we may
gather from the present of Earl Godwin to Hardecanute,
described by William of Malmesbury:&mdash;"Hardecanute
looking angrily upon Godwin, the earl was obliged to
clear himself by oath. But, in hopes of recovering entirely
the favour of the king, he added to his oath a
present of the most rich and beautiful kind. It was
a ship with a beak of gold, having on board eighty
soldiers, who wore two bracelets on either arm, each
weighing sixteen ounces of gold. They had gilt helmets;
in the right hand they carried a spear of iron;
on the left shoulder they bore a Danish axe; in a
word, they were equipped with such arms, as that,
splendour vying with terror, might conceal the steel
beneath the gold<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>."</p>

<p>The military system of the Danes in their own
country, and of their Scandinavian brethren, may be
gathered from what we have told of the changes wrought
in England by King Canute. By the laws of Gula,
said to have been originally established by King Hacon
the Good, in 940, whoever possessed the sum of six
marks, besides his clothes, was required to furnish himself
with a red shield of two boards in thickness (<i>tuibyrding</i>),
a spear, an axe or a sword. He who was
worth twelve marks was ordered to procure in addition
a steel cap (<i>stÃ¡l-hufu</i>); whilst he who was worth eighteen
marks was obliged to have a double red shield,
a helmet, a coat-of-fence or gambeson (<i>bryniu</i> or <i>panzar</i>),
and all usual weapons (<i>folkvopn</i>).</p>

<p>Italy, always the theatre of the most sanguinary wars,
torn and wasted by the troops of pope and of emperor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
and of its own citizens contending against each other;
invaded and overrun by barbarian neighbours,&mdash;by the
Hungarians on the north, and by the Saracens on the
south,&mdash;presented a <i>mÃ©lange</i> of warlike usages and warlike
equipment in which the East and the West, the
North and the South became intermingled in such a
manner as to give to the whole country the appearance
of a vast military masquerade; an <i>imbroglio</i> which, in
our time, it would be a useless attempt to resolve into
its original elements. In the eleventh century, the consuls
of the cities, succeeding to the functions which had
been enjoyed by the dukes and counts, commanded the
troops of their respective districts, and marched at their
head, whether the expedition was undertaken under the
banner of the emperor, or the result of a private dissension
between two rival cities. The forces employed in
these services differed in nothing from those of the west
of Europe; the strength of the host consisted of the
heavy-armed knights with lance and target, while the
communal levy fought with such weapons as they could
best wield or most easily obtain. The Hungarians, who
overran the country as far as the Tiber on the north, and
the Saracens, who harried the land to the south of that
river, acted in small bodies of light cavalry, compensating
by the rapidity of their movements for the inferior
solidity of their armament. Before the expeditions of
these marauders, the Italian cities had been open; but
their depredations at length (that is, about the close of
the ninth century,) caused the citizens to construct walls,
to organize a communal militia for the defence of their
homes, and to place officers selected from their own body
at the head of their little armies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>From very early times, and almost throughout the
middle ages, the clergy are found occasionally taking part
in warlike enterprises;&mdash;one principal reason of which
may have been, that, by personally heading their contingent,
they escaped from the exactions and caprices of the
vicedomini. Their presence in battle and siege is proved,
not only by the direct testimony of cotemporary writers,
but by the prohibitions that from time to time were
issued against the practice. From Gregory of Tours we
learn, that at the siege of Comminges by the Burgundian
monarch, the bishop of Gap often appeared among the
defenders of the town, hurling stones from the walls on
the assailants. Hugh, abbot of St. Quentin, a son of
Charlemagne, was slain before Toulouse, with the abbot
of FerriÃ¨re; and at the same time, two bishops were
made prisoners. The Saxon Chronicle, under the year
1056, says:&mdash;"Leofgar was appointed bishop. He was
the mass-priest of Harold the earl. He wore his knapsack
during his priesthood until he was a bishop. He
forsook his chrism and his rood, his ghostly weapons, and
took to his spear and his sword after his bishophood;
and so went to the field against Griffin, the Welsh king:
and there was he slain, and <i>his priests with him</i>." At
the Council of Estines, in 743, it is forbidden "to all who
are in the service of the Church to bear arms and to
fight, and none are to accompany the army but those
appointed to celebrate mass, to hear confessions, and to
carry the relics of the saints." The Council of Soissons,
in 744, records a similar prohibition against the abbots:&mdash;"Abbates
legitimi hostem non faciant, nisi tantum homines
eorum transmittant." The capitularies of Charlemagne
contain similar ordinances: the priests are forbidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
to combat "even against the pagans." The Anglo-Saxon
clerics seem to have been no less belligerent than
their neighbours; and Mr. Kemble sums up this part of
the question in the following words:&mdash;"Though it is probable
that the bishop's <i>gerefa</i> was bound to lead his contingent,
under the command of the ealdorman, yet we
have ample evidence that the prelates themselves did not
hold their station to excuse them from taking part in the
just and lawful defence of their country and religion
against strange and pagan invaders. Too many fell in
conflict to allow of our attributing their presence on the
field merely to their anxiety lest the belligerents should
be without the due consolations of religion; and in other
cases, upon the alarm of hostile incursions, we find the
levies stated to have been led against the enemy by the
duke and bishop of the district<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>."</p>

<p>If there were Churchmen whom it was difficult to restrain
from fight and foray, there were, on the other
hand, laics who sought to escape the service by donning
the cowl or chasuble. A capitulary of Charlemagne was
necessary to prevent certain "liberi homines" from becoming
either priests or monks, in order to avoid the
military duties attached to their station<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.</p>

<p>The matrons of the North appear occasionally to have
taken part in the defence of their country. William of
JumiÃ¨ges, describing the resistance of the Normans to the
attack of the English in 1000, writes:&mdash;"Sed et f&#339;minÃ¦
pugnatrices, robustissimos quosque hostium vectibus hydriarum
suarum excerebrantes." Wace, noticing the
same event, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>As we have before seen, the tactics of the Northern
nations were borrowed in a great measure from the
Romans. As early as the time of Tacitus, the Germans
disposed their troops in the form of the <i>cuneus</i>, or wedge:
"Acies per cuneos componitur."&mdash;(<i>Germania.</i>) And in
the account given by Agathias of the battle of the Casilinus
in 553, we are told that the wedge was still the arrangement
adopted for the central division of the Frankish
army, while the remainder was marshalled in two wings<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.</p>

<p>When a force of infantry had to contend against an
army in which many horse were employed, they sought
by serried ranks and by a favourable position to obtain the
advantage over their enemy. This was the plan of the
English at Hastings. A trench was before them,&mdash;</p>

<p>And Henry of Huntingdon: "quasi castellum, impenetrabile
Normannis." And again, Malmesbury: "All were
on foot, armed with battle-axes; and, covering themselves
in front by the junction of their shields, they
formed an impenetrable body, which would have secured
their safety that day, had not the Normans by a feigned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
flight induced them to open their ranks, which till that
time, <i>according to their custom</i>, were closely compacted<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>."</p>

<p>As early as the middle of the eleventh century, it was
sought to familiarize the Anglo-Saxons with the equestrian
mode of warfare of their neighbours, the Normans.
In 1055 the alien captain of the garrison of Hereford,
Raulfe, directed the English to serve on horseback;
which, says the chronicler, was contrary to their usage:
"Anglos <i>contra morem</i> in equis pugnare jussit<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>."</p>

<p>Omens in the earlier times, saintly relics in the later,
were held in the highest estimation for the assurance
of victory. The ancient Germans, as we learn from
CÃ¦sar, consulted their matrons as to the lucky hour for
them to engage battle, and would not advance till the
moon was propitious<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>. At the battle of the Casilinus,
already noticed, some of the German auxiliaries of the
Franks were unwilling to engage because their augurs
had declared the moment to be unfavourable<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. Gregory of
Tours notices the custom of the Christian kings of France
to seek a lucky omen from the services of the Church;
and recounts that Clovis, arriving in Touraine on his
expedition against Alaric, sent his retainers to the church
in which the body of Saint Martin was deposited, in
order to notice the words that should be uttered on their
entry within the sacred walls. The king's satisfaction
was extreme when the courtiers reported the passage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the eighteenth Psalm: "Tu mihi virtute ad bellum
accinctos meos adversarios subjicis<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>."</p>

<p>Harold's "lucky day" was Saturday; on which he
therefore fixes, to measure his strength with Duke William.
Saturday was his birthday, and his mother had
frequently assured him that projects undertaken on that
day would bring him good fortune:&mdash;</p>

<p>Saintly relics were carried in procession to insure a
successful expedition, or worn about the person of the
combatant, or enclosed in a feretory and set up on the
field of battle. Pope Gregory the Great included among
the presents which he sent to Childebert II., certain
relics which, worn round the neck in battle, would defend
him from all harm: "quÃ¦ collo suspensÃ¦ a malis

<p>In these days, when the shock of armies was not accompanied
by the thunder of cannon, when the silent
flight of the arrow, the hum of the sling-stone, or the
whirr of the javelin, were all that preceded the hand-to-hand
conflict, no small account was made of the various
war-cries of opposing chieftains. And not only war-cries,
but even songs, were employed to encourage the
assailants or intimidate the foe; of which the Song of
Roland, sung by Taillefer on the field of Hastings, is an
example in the memory of every reader. Snorro, in the
Heimskringla, has preserved a fragment of the improvised
verses sung by Harold Harfagar, as, mounted on his

previous to the battle of Stanford-Bridge<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>. The pagan
Northmen invoked their divinities,&mdash;a practice that was

<p>Let us now examine a little more in detail the arms,
offensive and defensive, of the various Northern tribes, at
whose military institutions and practices we have taken
so rapid a glance.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Spears</span> seem to have been of two kinds: the
longer spear in use among the cavalry, or to be employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a><br /><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a><br /><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
against them; and the shorter kind, which, as we have
seen, might serve either as a javelin, or for the thrust at
close quarters. In the accompanying groups of spear-heads,
found in graves in different parts of Europe, we
have collected the principal varieties of form<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>: the leaf-shaped,
the lozenge, the spike, the ogee, the barbed, and
the four-edged. These forms are infinitely varied in the
monuments of the time, by giving to the weapons more or
less of breadth or of slenderness. The blades are always
of iron, and those found in England have a longitudinal
opening in the socket. Their length is various, but they
usually range from ten to fifteen inches. In the cemetery
at Little Wilbraham, Cambridgeshire, the smallest found
was two and a half inches, the longest eighteen inches<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.
In the Ozingell cemetery (in Kent), they occur of twenty-one
inches in length<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>. The spear-heads of this period found
in Ireland differ but little from the examples discovered
in England and on the Continent. Those from the Ballinderry
find, observes Mr. Wakeman, "are singularly like
specimens found at Ozingell." In Anglo-Saxon interments,
the spears occur in much greater numbers than any of the
other weapons. The cemetery at Little Wilbraham produced
thirty-five spears, but only four swords; and the
axes, in all similar explorations, are of still greater rarity.
These usual types of the spear-head found in Great Britain
closely resemble those discovered in the graves of
France, Germany, Denmark, and Switzerland. Numerous
examples of them will be found figured in the AbbÃ©<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Cochet's work<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>, in Lindenschmit's Selzen Cemetery<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>, in
Worsaae's Copenhagen Museum<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>, and in Troyon's <i>Tombeaux
de Bel-Air</i>.</p>

<p>One of the first things that strikes the student in turning
over the illuminated manuscripts of the Anglo-Saxons,
and comparing their pictures with the relics procured
from the graves, is the great frequency in the paintings
of the barbed spear or <i>angon</i>, and its extreme rarity in
real examples. We have already seen, in the description
of Agathias, that this weapon was employed with fearful
effect by the Franks in the seventh century; and the
constant occurrence of it in the vellum-paintings of a
later date, leaves us no room to doubt that it was a
familiar form to our Teutonic ancestors. Yet its occurrence
in the graves is of the greatest rarity. We
have given, in our plate of spears, figure <a href="#i_094.jpg">17</a>, a specimen
of the barbed javelin, forming part of the Faussett
Collection, found in 1772 in a grave on Sibbertswould
Down, in Kent. Its length is eleven inches. Figure <a href="#i_108.jpg">23</a>
in the same plate is from Mr. Wylie's paper in the
ArchÃ¦ologia, (vol. <span class="smcap">xxxv</span>.); the original, of iron, and in
length sixteen inches, was found in a Norwegian tumulus.
Mr. Wylie has also engraved another example,
preserved in the <i>MusÃ©e de l'Artillerie</i> at Paris, said to
have been procured from a Merovingian grave. In the
AbbÃ© Cochet's work (Plate <span class="smcap">xvi</span>.) is figured another specimen,
from a grave at Envermeu, the length of which is
five inches; the barbs spreading out widely on each side,
exactly in the manner of the royal "broad-arrow." Several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
examples are given in Worsaae's Copenhagen Museum,
p. 69; one of which differs from the rest in having
the barb on one side only, the other side being leaf-shaped.
The barbed spear or javelin has also been found
at Mainz, Darmstadt, and Wiesbaden<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>; but in all cases
it occurs in very small proportion to the other weapons
discovered.</p>

<p>The four-edged spear-head is of still greater rarity. In
the graves opened by Mr. Wylie at Fairford, in Gloucestershire,
one of these curious weapons was obtained;
which we have copied from the volume describing this
find<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>, in our plate of spears, fig. <a href="#i_096.jpg">18</a>. It is of iron, sixteen
and a half inches in length, and two inches across at
the broadest part. "It reminds one," remarks Mr. Wylie,
"of the spear of Thorolf in Eigil's Saga:" "Cujus
ferrum duas ulnas longum, in mucronem <i>quatuor acies
habentem</i>, desinebat." These four-edged weapons are of
the highest antiquity;&mdash;compare those of the Egyptians,
figured and described in Sir Gardner Wilkinson's work<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>.</p>

<p>Another variety, found at Douvrend, and figured at
page 283 of <i>La Normandie Souterraine</i>, has a leaf-shaped
blade with recurved hooks at the socket end. Mr. Wylie
has given this example in his paper in the ArchÃ¦ologia,
(vol. xxxv. p. 48,) and considers it to be the weapon
named by Sidonius as forming part of the Frankish warrior's
equipment: "<i>lanceis uncatis</i>, securibusque missilibus
dextrÃ¦ refertÃ¦." Four other examples of this spear
were found in the valley of the Eaulne<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.</p>

<p>Occasionally the spear-head was formed with its two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
sides on different planes; with the object, as it would
appear, of giving a rotary motion to the weapon when
used as a javelin. Two examples of this construction are
described and engraved in the account of the excavations,
by Mr. Akerman, at Harnham Hill, near Salisbury<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>.</p>

<p>The spear-head was generally attached to its shaft by
means of rivets passing through the socket into the wood
beneath. Sometimes, in lieu of the socket, there was a
spike at the base of it, which was driven <i>into</i> the wood,
as in one of the Livonian examples, now in the British
Museum, and figured in Dr. BÃ¤hr's work, <i>Die GrÃ¤ber der
Liven</i>. Sometimes, again, a ferule of bronze or iron was
added to the socketed spear-head at its junction with the
staff, as in the example in Mr. Rolfe's museum, at Sandwich,
obtained from the Ozingell graves, and figured on
our Plate <span class="smcap"><a href="#i_049.jpg">ii</a></span>., fig. 6. In this instance the ferule was of
bronze. One of iron occurred in the cemetery at Linton
Heath, Cambridgeshire, (figured in ArchÃ¦ol. Journal,
vol. xi. p. 106). In manuscript illuminations the spear-head
of the Anglo-Saxons is constantly represented with
one or more cross-bars at the base of the blade. A spear
of iron having a cross-piece of analogous form was found
among Anglo-Saxon relics near Nottingham in recent
excavations, and has been added to the Tower Collection.
It is engraved in the ArchÃ¦ological Journal, vol. viii.
p. 425. Similar examples are figured in the Illustrated
Catalogue of Mr. Roach Smith's Museum, p. 103.</p>

<p>The shaft itself appears to have been generally of ash.
Portions of the wood have been found at Wilbraham, at
Ozingell, at Northfleet, and other places. Some of that
from Northfleet, having been examined by Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Lindley and by Mr. Girdwood, has been pronounced to
be undoubtedly ash<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>. The general use of this wood is
strikingly confirmed by several passages in "Beowulf,"
that curious Anglo-Saxon poem which the concurring
opinion of the best Northern scholars has assigned to
the close of the eighth century:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Their javelins piled together stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The seamen's arms, of ashen wood."&mdash;<i>Line</i> 654.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And again, line 3535:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thus I the Hring-danes<br /></span>
<span class="i1">for many a year<br /></span>
<span class="i1">governed under heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i1">and secured them with war<br /></span>
<span class="i1">from many tribes<br /></span>
<span class="i1">throughout this earth<br /></span>
<span class="i1">with spears and swords."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">(<i>Ã†scum and ecgum.</i>)<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In this passage, <i>Ã¦scum</i>, ash, is put for the spear itself.
Mr. Roach Smith has collected several other instances of
a similar kind. "In CÃ¦dmon, the term <i>Ã¦sc-berend</i>, or
spear-bearer, is applied to a soldier." In the fragment of
the poetical "History of Judith" we have <i>Ã¦sc-plega</i>, the
play of spears, as a poetic term for a battle. So we have
<i>Ã¦sc-bora</i>, a spear-bearer; and in the Codex Exoniensis,
<i>Ã¦sc-stede</i>, a field of battle. And again, in "Beowulf:"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Eald Ã†sc-wiga.</i>"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Some old spear-warrior<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the eleventh century we find the ashen spear again
mentioned. Robert of Aix, describing the knights his
companions in the First Crusade, says: "HastÃ¦ <i>fraxineÃ¦</i>
in manibus eorum ferro acutissimo prÃ¦fixÃ¦ sunt, quasi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
grandes perticÃ¦<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>." The AbbÃ© Cochet, however, describes
the remains of a lance-shaft found at Envermeu as being
of oak; black with age, and of an extreme hardness<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>.</p>

<p>The staves were sometimes of a rich and costly character.
The heriot of the Anglo-Saxon Wulfsige consisted
of two horses, one helmet, one byrnie, one sword, and a
spear twined with gold<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>.</p>

<p>The spear-staves deposited in the graves are necessarily
of the shorter kind: the length of the entire weapon
being about six feet; a fact easily ascertained by measuring
the distance from the blade to the iron shoe,
where that is found. This iron shoe is generally a hollow
spike, into which the wood was fitted; as in that of the
"Fairford Graves," Plate <span class="smcap">xi</span>.; the one from Northfleet,
(figured in the Journal of the ArchÃ¦ological Association,
vol. iii.); and another in the Faussett Collection, found
at Ash-by-Sandwich. Sometimes it was a button, to be
driven into the shaft by means of a nail issuing from its
centre. An example of this variety is engraved in the
<i>Nenia Britannica</i> of Douglas.</p>

<p>Those who used the shorter spear or javelin were provided
with several of these weapons, which they hurled
successively at the enemy. In Harleian MS., No. 603,
folio 30<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>, may be seen a spearman holding three lozenge-headed
javelins. CÃ¦dmon's Paraphrase (ArchÃ¦ologia,
vol. xxiv. Plate <span class="smcap">lv</span>.) has a figure carrying three barbed
javelins (<i>angones</i>). In Harl. MS., 603, folio 56<sup>b</sup>, the
Destroying Angel has three barbed spears, one of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
is represented in its flight, another poised in the right
hand, ready to follow, while the third is held in the left
hand, to be employed in its turn. This curious example
has been figured by Mr. Akerman, to illustrate his paper,
"On some of the Weapons of the Celtic and Teutonic
Races," in vol. xxxiv. of the ArchÃ¦ologia.</p>

<p>Vegetius (lib. i. c. 2.) tells us that, in his day, the
barbarians were armed with two or three javelins, a
weapon which had fallen into disuse among the Romans.
In the Bayeux tapestry there are figures of the Anglo-Saxons
furnished with three or four of these missiles.
Even in the graves of these people, the spears are sometimes
found in pairs. Sir Henry Dryden, in his explorations
at Marston Hill, in Northamptonshire, met with
two warriors having two spears each. And the Hon. Mr.
Neville found at Little Wilbraham, in Cambridgeshire, another
example of a similar kind. The Wilbraham Cemetery
disclosed another curious usage. Where cremation
had been employed, spear-heads (and knives also) were in
several cases discovered in the urns. Kings as well as
their followers were buried with their weapons beside
them. The spear-head found in the tomb of Childeric,
which is of lozenge form, is engraved in the <i>Milice FranÃ§oise</i>
of Father Daniel. This tomb was discovered in
1655, and the weapons found in it are preserved in
the Imperial Library at Paris<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>.</p>

<p>A singular usage appears to have prevailed when the
spear and the axe were deposited in the same grave.
The spear in this case was reversed,&mdash;the point at the
feet of the warrior. Examples of this practice have
been observed in Normandy, at Mondorf, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Selzen<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>. At Wilbraham, spear-heads were found at the
feet<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.</p>

<p>The pagan Northmen sought to enhance the value of
their arms by referring their fabrication to weapon-smiths
of a preternatural power. The Christianized Germans of
the tenth century obtained a similar result by the employment
of iron from the reliquary. At the coronation
of the Emperor Otho the Great, in 961, Walpert, archbishop
of Milan, presided at the solemnities: the prince
placed on the altar of Saint Ambrose all the royal insignia;
the lance, of which the head had been forged out
of one of the nails of the true cross, the royal sword, the
axe, the belt, and the royal mantle. After some intervening
ceremonies, he was again armed with the weapons
which had been laid upon the altar, and the archbishop
placed on his head the iron crown of Lombardy<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>.</p>

<p>Not the least interesting among the many singular
objects discovered by the AbbÃ© Cochet in his researches
in Normandy, is the little silver coin containing the portrait
of "un guerrier frank debout." In his right hand
the warrior carries his lance, while the left appears to
hold the well-known round target of his time. This
curious little relic is engraved on page 359 of the <i>Normandie
Souterraine</i>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Swords</span> of the ante-Norman period may be divided
into three classes: the earlier broadsword without cross-piece,
straight, double-edged, and acutely pointed; the
later sword, similar in fashion to the above, but having
a guard, or cross-piece; and the curved weapon with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a><br /><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a><br /><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
concave edge, called in Anglo-Saxon the <i>seax</i>; the <i>sica</i>
of classical times. The first has become familiar to us
from the numerous examples procured from the graves
of France, Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, and England.
This type agrees exactly with the description left us by
Sidonius Apollinaris; who, recording a victory obtained
by the Franks over the Goths, has this passage: "Alii
hebetatorum cÃ¦de gladiorum latera dentata pernumerant.
Alii <i>cÃ¦sim atque punctim</i> foraminatos circulos loricarum
metiuntur<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>." We have engraved, figure 1 of our plate
of swords, a fine specimen of this kind of weapon, which
was found among the "Fairford Graves." It is nearly
three feet in length (the usual size of these swords), and
when dug up, had fragments of the wood and leather
which once formed its scabbard, still adhering to the iron.
Other examples discovered in England are engraved in
Mr. Neville's "Saxon Obsequies," Mr. Akerman's "Pagan
Saxondom," and in the account of the Ozingell Cemetery<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>.
German specimens appear in the "Selzen Cemetery," Swiss
in the <i>Tombeaux de Bel-Air</i>, Danish in the "Copenhagen
Museum," p. 66, and Frankish in <i>La Normandie Souterraine</i>.
The Irish swords are shorter than others of this
date,&mdash;not exceeding thirty inches,&mdash;as we learn from the
researches of Mr. Wakeman<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>. That this sword of the
earlier Iron Period resembled the anterior bronze sword
in being without cross-piece, seems clear from two facts.
Firstly, no such provision (except in one or two isolated
cases) is found to accompany the weapons disclosed by
the graves; secondly, it has been remarked, that in
many instances, where the wood of the handle and that
of the sheath remain, they approach so closely together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
that there is no space left for any intervening appendage.</p>

<p>The sword with cross-piece appears to belong to the
later Iron Period. When real examples are found in
this country, and in others early Christianised, they are
generally dredged from the beds of rivers, or turned up
among old foundations; though in states where paganism
held a longer sway, they are obtained from the graves.
Two very early English specimens are figured in the
"Pagan Saxondom:" one found at Gilton, in Kent, and
now in Mr. Rolfe's Museum; the other found at Coombe,
in Kent, and preserved in the collection of Mr. Boreham.
The cross-piece in these examples has projected but little
beyond the edges of the blade. From specimens given
in our plates, and from the numerous representations of
Anglo-Saxon manuscripts, we see that the guard eventually
became a much more prominent feature of the
Northern brand.</p>

<p>The third variety of the Anglo-Saxon sword, the <i>seax</i>,
which Mr. Kemble<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> defines to be "ensis quidam curvatus,"
is apparently that old Thracian weapon, the <i>sica</i>,
which among the Romans was in such little repute, that
<i>sicarius</i> came to mean a bandit, or an assassin. The
Anglo-Saxon curved sword never appears in their book-paintings,
and has not been found in their graves. But
in the Copenhagen Museum is a weapon which seems
exactly to answer this description of the Northern <i>seax</i>.
It is engraved in Mr. Worsaae's "Illustrations of the
Copenhagen Museum," p. 97, fig. 384.</p>

<p>The handle of the earlier sword appears often to have
been a mere haft, like that of our knives; sometimes it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
had a pommel. The later sword-handle consisted of
grip, pommel, and cross-piece. The grip seems to have
been commonly of wood, and it is not unusual to find
portions of this wood still adhering to the tang of those
swords which have been recovered from the graves.
Part of such a hilt, found at Northfleet, in Kent, was
submitted to the examination of Professor Lindley, and
pronounced to be pine. Mr. Worsaae is of opinion that
the Danish swords had the handle covered with "wood,
leather, bone, or horn; which, however, is now consumed<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>."
Mr. Wakeman tells us that some of the
Ancient-Irish iron swords "have been found with the
handle of bone remaining." Generally the cross-bar
was straight; but sometimes it curved towards the
blade; as in Cott. MSS., Tiberius, C. vi. fol. 9; Cleopatra,
C. viii., in many places; in that fine sword found in the
river Witham, and preserved in the British Museum;
in the sword discovered in a tumulus in Lancashire (engraved
in ArchÃ¦ol. Journal, vol. vi. p. 75); and in the
examples given in our plate of swords, figs. 9, 10, 11,
from Dr. BÃ¤hr's Livonian Collection. These cross-pieces
of metal were often, as well as the pommels, richly decorated.
The specimen from the Witham, named above,
has both pommel and guard, which are of iron, inlaid
with gold and copper in a pattern of lozenges. The
most usual forms of the pommel were trefoil, cinquefoil,
hemispherical, round, and triangular. To some a little
ring was added, probably to attach a sword-knot; as in
the example already noticed from Gilton, and figured in
the "Pagan Saxondom." Of the other kinds named
above, the first four occur constantly in the miniatures of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Anglo-Saxon books, and it is difficult to understand on
what grounds the swords with foliated pommels, when
found in this country, are so generally assigned to the
Danes. The triangular pommel is more rare. In our
plate, fig. 7, we give an example in an ancient Norwegian
sword in the possession of Dr. Thurnum. It is entirely
of iron, measuring 3 feet, 1&frac12; inches. A sword of similar
form is engraved in Worsaae's "Copenhagen Museum,"
p. 97.</p>

<p>That the sword-hilts were occasionally of a costly
character, we have the concurring testimony of ancient
charters, poets, chroniclers, and of the graves. The
poetical Edda records that Gunnar, a <i>regulus</i> of Germany,
replied to the messenger of Attila,&mdash;"Seven
chests have I filled with swords; each of them has a
hilt of gold: my weapon is exceedingly sharp; my bow
is worthy of the bench it graces; my byrnies are golden;
my helmet and white shield came from the hall of
Kiars<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>." Kiars was a <i>regulus</i> of Gaul. In "Beowulf"
(line 1338), the "Great Prince" delivers into the keeping
of his servant "his ornamented sword, the costliest of
blades" (<i>irena cyst</i>). Again: "The son of Healfdene
gave to Beowulf a golden ensign, as the reward of victory;
a treasure with a twisted hilt, a helm and byrnie,
a mighty valued sword many beheld borne before the
warrior." (Line 2033.) At line 3228, we have "the hilt
variegated with treasure;" and afterwards (line 3373,)
we read of a "sword, the costliest of irons, with twisted
hilt, and variegated like a snake." In this passage,
both sword and simile are curiously illustrative of the
ornamental art of the Anglo-Saxons, of which so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
examples have come down to us. A document of the
early part of the tenth century, given in Mr. Thorpe's
"Anglo-Saxon Laws<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>," distinguishing between the <i>eorl</i>
and the <i>ceorl</i>, declares, that if the latter "thrive so well,
that he have a helm and byrnie, and a sword ornamented
with gold, if he have not five hides of land,
he is notwithstanding a ceorl." We have already seen
that Canute's huscarlas were armed "with axes, halbards,
and swords inlaid with gold." Eginhard tells us
that the belt of Charlemagne was "of gold or silver,
and the hilt of his sword was made of gold and precious
stones." And of the splendid galley fitted out by Earl
Godwin, as a present to Hardiknut, we are told that the
warriors had "swords whose hilts were of gold."</p>

<p>Among the heriots enumerated by Mr. Kemble<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>, that
of Beorhtric, about 962, includes a sword worth eighty
mancuses of gold. And Duke Ã†lfheah was possessor
of another of the same value. In the will of prince
Ã†thelstan, dated 1015, is named "a silver-hilted sword
which Woolfricke made." Guillaume de JumiÃ¨ges and
Dudon de S. Quentin tell us that Richard the First,
duke of Normandy, rewarded the services of two knights
by presenting to each a sword whose hilt of gold weighed
four pounds, and a bracelet of gold of the same weight.
In illuminated manuscripts of this period, the mountings
of swords are generally coloured yellow, implying
probably a surface of gold, whether from thin plates
of that metal, or from gilding. In the Fausset Collection
is the bronze pommel of a sword, which has
been richly gilt. The mountings of another in the
British Museum are inlaid with gold. In Mr. Rolfe's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
possession are examples both in gilded bronze and of
silver. In Denmark, hilts have been found "partly
of silver, or inlaid with silver, or with gold chains
attached to them<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>." Other Danish swords were surrounded
with chains of gold, or covered with plates of
gold and silver; and swords with handles entirely of
silver have also been discovered<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>. Coloured beads appear
sometimes to have formed part of the decorations of the
Anglo-Saxon sword. Mr. Neville remarks, in his description
of the relics found at Wilbraham, that "an
immense blue-and-white perforated Bead accompanied
three out of the four swords, probably as an appendage
to the hilt or some part of the scabbard." On Plate
<span class="smcap">xxi</span>. of his "Saxon Obsequies" he has figured two of
these beads: one is an inch and three-quarters in diameter,
the other an inch and a quarter. Occasionally,
runic or Latin inscriptions appear upon these weapons.
In "Beowulf" this usage is noticed:&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Mr. Rolfe had the good fortune to become the possessor
of a sword-pommel thus "rightly marked." It is of silver,
and was found at Ash-by-Sandwich. The runes occupy one
side only of the pommel, the other having zigzag and triangular
ornaments. This curious relic has been figured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
in the "ArchÃ¦ological Album," "Pagan Saxondom,"
and in Mr. Wright's "Celt, Roman, and Saxon." Professor
Thomsen of Copenhagen informs the writer of these
pages that, in Denmark, swords of the latest pagan period
have been found, having runic inscriptions formed by
letters of iron let into the iron blade. In the Tower collection
may be seen a sword of somewhat later date, in
which also is exhibited this curious practice, of inserting
letters of iron into an iron blade. Among the swords
found in Ireland, attributed to the Scandinavian settlers
in that country, instances have occurred of inscriptions
"in Latin letters<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>." In the Northern Sagas, frequent
mention is made of the swords of their heroes being
marked with runes; and the evidences we have adduced
are of no small value in shewing the correctness of these
writings as regards the ordinary usages of the time.</p>

<p>A further distinction was conferred on the swords
of the great heroes of the North;&mdash;they were honoured
with particular names. In the Wilkina Saga we read
of "the sword called <i>Gramr</i>, which is the best of all
swords," with which Sigurdr slays the cunning smith,
Mimer; and again, of the weapon named <i>Naglhringr</i>, obtained
for Dietrich of Bern, by the dwarf Alpris, (c. xvi.)
Vermund the Wise armed his son Uffe with the brand
<i>Skrep</i>, none other being proportioned to his strength.
That of Rolf Krage was called <i>Skrofnung</i>. In "Beowulf"
(canto xxi.), we have "the hilted knife named <i>Hrunting</i>,"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"wÃ¦s Ã¾am hÃ¦ft-mece<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Hrunting nama;"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>whose "edge was iron stained with poisonous twigs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
hardened in gore." And in canto xxvi. of the same
poem we learn that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>NÃ¦gling</i>, old sword and gray of hue,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">False in the fray, in splinters flew."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>King Hacon the Good, Snorro tells us, "girded round him
his sword called <i>Kuernbit</i>" (millstone-biter). Thorolf, in
Egil's Saga, "was armed with a sword named <i>Lang</i>, a
mickle weapon and good." In Magnus Barfot's Saga (cap.
xxvi.), the king wore "a most sharp sword called <i>Leggbitr</i>,
the hilt of which was made of the tooth of the Rosmar
(walrus), and ornamented with gold." The sword <i>Mimung</i>
was no whit inferior to any of these. It was forged
by Weland, in a trial of skill with another celebrated
weapon-smith, Amilias by name. Weland first made a
sword with which he cut a thread of wool lying on the
water. But not content with this, he re-forged the blade,
which then cut through the whole ball of floating wool.
Still dissatisfied, he again passed it through the fire, and
at length produced so keen a weapon that it divided a
whole bundle of wool floating in water. Amilias, on his
part, forged a suit of armour so much to his own satisfaction
that, sitting down on a stool, he bade Weland try
his weapon upon him. Weland obeyed, and there being
no apparent effect, asked Amilias if he felt any particular
sensation. Amilias said he felt as though cold water had
passed through his bowels. Weland then bade him
shake himself. On doing so, the effect of the blow was
apparent: he fell dead in two pieces<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>
<p>The skilful weaponer was always a person of high consideration
in these days. This is curiously shewn in the
law of Ethelbert which enacts that "if one man slay
another, he is to pay his wergyld: but not so, if the slayer
happen to be the king's weapon-smith or his messenger;
in that case, he is to pay only a moderated wergyld of a
hundred shillings<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>."</p>

<p>We have already noticed the curious custom of burying
the spear-head in the same vase with the bones of the
Anglo-Saxon warrior. An analogous practice has been observed
in Denmark; where the sword of the hero, broken
into several pieces, is placed over the mouth of the urn.
An example of this kind of interment is engraved in
Worsaae's "Copenhagen Museum," p. 98. Occasionally
the iron sword, having been softened by the fire, was bent,
and in this state deposited in the grave. The AbbÃ©
Cochet remarks:&mdash;"Cet usage des sabres ployÃ©s au feu
et enterrÃ©s avec les morts est trÃ¨s-rare chez nous: il
s'est rencontrÃ© en Allemagne, en Danemark, et en Suisse,
ou M. de Bonstetton en a vu un grand nombre, en 1851,
dans les sÃ©pultures de Tiefenau, prÃ¨s Berne. Ce savant
ajoute que cette coutume, plus barbare que romaine, peu
connue des HelvÃ¨tes, Ã©tait trÃ¨s-frÃ©quente chez les peuples
Scandinaves. Il existe, dit-il, au musÃ©e de Schwerin
plusieurs glaives en fer que l'on croit provenir des Vendes,
et qui ont Ã©tÃ© rougis dans le feu et ensuite ployÃ©s. Baehr

Segevold<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>."</p>

<p>The Sheaths of the swords were commonly of wood
covered with leather, as we learn from the graves; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
they were sometimes mounted in bronze. Figure 2 of
our fourth Plate shews an example from Wilbraham, in
which the locket and chape are of bronze; and the Livonian
sword, Plate <span class="smcap"><a href="#i_060.jpg">v</a></span>. fig. 10, has an ornamented bronze
chape. In the British Museum is an Anglo-Saxon blade
found in a grave at Battle Edge, Oxfordshire, which retains
the bronze chape and locket of its scabbard. These
fitments were sometimes gilt, or even of gold. Mr. Worsaae,
in his "Primeval Antiquities of Denmark," page 50,
has figured the gold locket of a sword-sheath, adorned
with the winding pattern so characteristic of this period.
Wood and leather were the ordinary materials used in
the Danish scabbards. Of the sheaths formed of these
substances, which have been partially preserved to our
times, the most curious example is that figured by Mr.
Bateman in vol. vii. of the Journal of the ArchÃ¦ological Association.
It was found in a barrow in Derbyshire, and is
constructed of thin wood overlaid with leather, the surface
of the latter being covered with a pattern of alternate
fillets and lozenges. A scabbard found at Strood, in Kent,
was formed externally of a substance resembling shagreen.
Dr. BÃ¤hr, in <i>Die GrÃ¤ber der Liven</i>, Plate <span class="smcap">xv</span>., has engraved
a dagger-sheath, which is entirely of bronze, from
Ascheraden; and in the <i>Abbildungen von Mainzer AltherthÃ¼mern</i>
for 1852, is another bronze dagger-sheath, containing
an iron dagger, which was found near Treves.
Several are in the British Museum. Mr. Roach Smith
has another, found in the Thames;&mdash;all of them probably
belonging to the period under consideration. There
is also a curious type of sword-scabbard, formed entirely
of bronze, which further observation may probably
shew to be of Northern make. The example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
here engraved was found on a moor near
Flasby, in Yorkshire; it contains the
blade of an iron sword. Several similar
ones have been discovered. One dug up
at Stanwick has been presented by the
Duke of Northumberland to the British
Museum. Another is engraved in Dr.
Wilson's "Annals of Scotland," found
near Edinburgh. A fourth, from the
bed of the Isis, is figured in the ArchÃ¦ological
Journal, vol. x. p. 259. The
Earl of Londesborough has another,
dredged from the Thames, which differs
from the rest in having been ornamented
with enamelled studs. This is engraved
in vol. iii. of the <i>Collectanea Antiqua</i>. See
also the Danish example, figured in Worsaae's
"Copenhagen Museum," p. 66. All
these bronze scabbards have contained
iron blades.</p>

<p>The Sword-Belts appear to have been
usually girt round the waist; the buckles
and tongues of them having often been
found in the graves. These fitments are
generally of bronze, sometimes of copper;
and the metal is not unfrequently gilt,
or embossed, or enamelled. Some buckles
in the Faussett collection, found in Kent,
are set with garnets. The belt was occasionally
worn across the body, suspended
from the right shoulder; as in
the fine figure in Cotton MS., Tiberius,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
C. vi. fol. 9. Our woodcut, No. <a href="#i_094.jpg">17</a>, furnishes an example
of the belt girt round the waist, from an illumination
in Add. MS., No. 18,043.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Axe</span>, as we have seen, was a characteristic weapon
of the Northern nations. It is not unfrequently found
in the graves of these people on the Continent, but in
Anglo-Saxon interments it is of the extremest rarity.
In the Wilbraham excavations, a hundred graves yielded
only two axes. In the Fairford researches, not one was
found in a hundred and twenty graves; and in the
many Kentish barrows examined by the Earl of Londesborough
in 1841, not a single specimen was obtained.
The axe appears to have been of three principal forms:
the "taper axe," the broad axe, and the double-axe, or
bipennis. The pole-axe and the adze-axe were varieties
of these. The battle-axe was also called <i>francisca</i>, from
the favour with which it was regarded by the Franks.
Isidorus (lib. xviii. c. 8.) tells us of "Secures quas
Hispani ab usu Francorum per derivationem <i>franciscas</i>
vocant."</p>

<p>Examples of the Anglo-Saxon taper-axe, from the
Ozingell Cemetery, are given in figures 1 and 2 of our
Plate. Figures 3 and 4, found in Ireland, fig. 6, from
Selzen in Germany, and fig. 9, from Livonia, closely resemble
the Kentish ones. Fig. 8, from Livonia, differs chiefly
in having a prolongation at the back. Specimens of the
taper-axe found in France are given in Plates <span class="smcap">vii</span>., <span class="smcap">ix</span>., and
<span class="smcap">xi</span>. of <i>La Normandie Souterraine</i>; and Danish examples
occur at pages 68 and 96 of Worsaae's "Copenhagen
Museum." Some of the axe-heads dug up in Denmark exhibit
a very curious transitional construction; the blade
being of copper edged with iron. Another axe in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a><br /><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Copenhagen Museum, "of the very earliest times of the
iron period," is inscribed with runes. The axe found in
the tomb of Childeric is of the "taper" form already described;
it is represented in Plate <span class="smcap">ii</span>. of Daniel's <i>Milice
FranÃ§oise</i>. We have already, by the passages from Sidonius
and Procopius, seen how the sons of Odin commenced
their attack by hurling their axes at the foe. A
curious illustration of this practice of throwing the axe is
afforded by a charter of Canute, granting to the monks
of Christ Church, Canterbury, the port-dues of Sandwich,
"from Pepernesse to Mearcesfleote, as far as a taper-axe
can be thrown on the shore from a vessel afloat at high
water<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>:" <span class="saxon">sw&#257; feorr sw&#257; mÃ¦&#541; &#257;n taper-Ã¦x beon &#541;eworpen &#363;

   <p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">Plate VII.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Figure 10 of our Plate, from Livonia, offers a variety
from the axe already described, in having an angle in its
under line. A similar contour is found in examples discovered
in Normandy, and figured on Plate <span class="smcap">vii</span>. of the
AbbÃ© Cochet's work. The broad-axe is seen in our
figures 5 and 7; the first from Selzen, the other from
Livonia. Compare the Frankish specimen engraved at
page 233 of <i>La Normandie Souterraine</i>. Others have
been found in England.</p>

<p>The single-axe used by the Anglo-Saxons in battle
does not seem to have differed in form from those employed
in woodcraft; as may be seen by referring to the
Calendar contained in Cotton MS., Julius, A. vi., faithfully
copied in Shaw's "Dresses and Decorations." Indeed,
it is probable that the blade which had felled an
oak was often called upon to strike down an enemy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Manuscripts do not frequently give pictures of the
battle-axe; but examples occur in Cott. MS., Cleop., C.
viii., and in the Anglo-Saxon Benedictional of the Library
of Rouen.</p>

<p>The double-axe is of still more rare occurrence in
book-paintings. It appears in two places in Harleian
MS., No. 603, but this is a work not earlier than the
close of the eleventh century. In the graves, the bipennis
has never been found at all; neither is it seen
in the hands of the Anglo-Saxons in the Bayeux Tapestry.
But if the bipennis of the true classical form, that
is, having two vertical blades, has not hitherto been
seen among the varied contents of the Northmen's
graves, a very singular variety of this implement has
been discovered among the tombs of the Valley of the
Eaulne. It is a kind of adze-axe, the one blade being
vertical, the other horizontal. It was found by the
AbbÃ© Cochet in the cemetery of Parfondeval, and has
been engraved in his work, p. <a href="#Page_306">306</a>, and in the <i>ArchÃ¦ologia</i>,
vol. xxxv., p. 229. The adze form of one of the
blades would seem to indicate rather an artificer's tool
than a warrior's weapon, and the AbbÃ© tells us that the
peasants have still such an implement, which they call
their <i>bisaiguÃ«</i> (p. <a href="#Page_307">307</a>). We may remember, however,
that an authority for the military use of the horizontal
blade exists in the effigy at Malvern<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>.</p>

<p>The Pole-axe is the almost universal form of this arm
in the Bayeux tapestry. Not only the Saxon soldiery,
but Harold, and even Duke William himself, are armed
with this fearful weapon. Indeed, for a force of infantry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
as the English were, contending against cavalry,
no other kind of axe could have been of much service.
Wace, whose minute descriptions, wearisome enough to
the general reader, are invaluable to the archÃ¦ologist,
has not lost sight of the long-handled axes of the
islanders. He has even given us the particular dimension
of the head,&mdash;"ki fu d'acier:"&mdash;</p>

<p>The handle of the Axe was of wood, traces of which
have been observed in the relics obtained from the graves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
In a single instance, it has been found of iron. This
example occurred at LÃ¨de, in Belgium, and has been described
by M. Rigollot in the <i>MÃ©moires de la SociÃ©tÃ© des

<p>The Guisarme is a weapon frequently mentioned by
our early chroniclers and poets; but, though it is sometimes
made to be identical with the pole-axe, at others it
is distinguished from that arm. Wace tells us it was
"sharp, long, and broad:"&mdash;</p>

<p>The Statute of Arms of King William of Scotland (1165-1214)
enacts: "Et qui minus habet quam <span class="smcap">xl</span>. solidos,
habeat Gysarm, quod dicitur Hand-axe<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>." From another
Scottish ordinance we learn that the hand-axe was a
long-handled weapon. The Provost of Edinburgh in
1552 directs: "Because of the greit slauchteris done

<p>Knives of various sizes are constantly found in the
Northern graves. The smaller were evidently for domestic
purposes, for they are discovered in female interments
as well as in those of the other sex. But the
larger kind appear to have been used as daggers. They
have been more frequently observed in the continental
tombs than in those of our island; and, as they very
rarely appear in the pictures of the Anglo-Saxons, we
may conclude that they formed no necessary part of the
equipment of these warriors. A fine example of this
weapon is given on our ninth Plate (fig. 1,) from the
Ozingell Cemetery. It is sixteen inches in length, of
iron, and is provided with a cross-piece. In the following
group from the Anglo-Saxon and Latin Psalter of the
Duc de Berri, in the Paris Library,
the spearman's adversary
appears to be employing
exactly such an instrument
as the example from the
Kentish grave<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>. Figure 2 in
our Plate is a two-edged dagger of iron from the Faussett<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a><br /><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
collection. It was found near Ash-by-Sandwich, and
measures ten inches in the blade. Figures 3 and 4 are
Ancient Irish. The first is the ordinary type of this
weapon, of which many have been found. The second is
remarkable from the retention of its handle, which is of
wood, and ornamented with carving. Both these are
from Mr. Wakeman's paper on Irish Antiquities in vol.
iii. of the <i>Collectanea Antiqua</i>. Figures 5 and 6 are
German examples, from the Selzen graves. The first is
very remarkable from the ring at the extremity of the
tang. In Denmark, daggers have been found of a transitional
period, the bulk of the blade being of bronze,
edged on both sides with iron. Other Danish examples
are given in Mr. Worsaae's "Copenhagen Museum," pages
66 and 97. In Dr. BÃ¤hr's explorations in Livonia, a
dagger of iron was discovered with its bronze sheath.
(See <i>Die GrÃ¤ber der Liven</i>, Plate <span class="smcap">xv</span>.) Gregory of Tours,
in the sixth century, mentions in several places that the
Frankish soldiers carried large knives at their belts;
and there seems no reason to doubt that the examples
from the graves are the very "cultri validi" of the
historian. Of these Frankish war-knives, several specimens
are figured in the <i>Normandie Souterraine</i>. They
closely resemble those found in Germany, Switzerland,
Denmark, and England. The handles appear to have
been of wood. One of the Frankish examples still had
portions of the wooden haft remaining<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>. Other specimens
of the Northern <i>cultelli</i> will be found collected on
Plate <span class="smcap">lviii</span>. of the second volume of the <i>Collectanea Antiqua</i>.
Some of these weapons appear to have been inlaid
with copper or other metal; for which purpose one or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
more incised lines are formed near the back of the blade.
An Anglo-Saxon knife found in excavations in the city
of London, and engraved (fig. 3.) in the Plate of the <i>Collectanea
Antiqua</i> already noticed, still retains the bronze
inlaying in the channels of its blade.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i_079.jpg" id="i_079.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/i_079.jpg" alt="Plate IX." title="Plate IX." />
   <p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">Plate IX.</span></p>
</div>

<p>A curious variety of the war-knife is in the collection
of Mr. Roach Smith, of which the single edge is straight,
or nearly so, and the point formed by a diagonal cut at
the back of the blade. It is believed, in its perfect
state, to have measured upwards of thirty inches; is of
steel; and has on both sides a double line of the channelling
already noticed<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>. A weapon of similar form appears
among the Livonian antiquities now in the British Museum,
and is represented on Plate <span class="smcap">xix</span>. of Dr. BÃ¤hr's
<i>GrÃ¤ber der Liven</i>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Long-bow</span> was another weapon of this era. Agathias,
indeed, has told us that the Franks used neither
bow nor sling. But arrows are expressly mentioned in
the Salic Law; and, to reconcile these conflicting testimonies,
it has been suggested that the archery of the
Salic Law is that of the chase alone. <i>Poisoned</i> arrows,
however, are here named, and the hunter does not ply
his art with poisoned shafts. "Si quis alterum de sagitta
toxicata percutere voluerit<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>," &amp;c. Further on, a
fine is fixed for him who shall deprive another of his
"second finger, with which he directs his arrow:"&mdash;secundum
digitum, quo sagittatur. At a later period,
the bow is especially commanded as a part of the soldier's
equipment. One of the capitularies of Charlemagne
directs&mdash;"that the Count be careful to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
his contingent fully furnished for the field; that they
have lance, shield, a bow with two strings and twelve
arrows," &amp;c. According to the testimony of Henry
of Huntingdon, William the Conqueror reproached the
English with their want of this weapon. The Bayeux
tapestry, however, seems to authorize the belief that they
were not entirely without it. (See the first group of
Anglo-Saxons in Stothard's <span class="smcap">xiv</span><sup>th</sup>. plate.) The probability
seems to be that, while the Normans employed
archers in large bodies, the English merely interspersed
them in small numbers among their men-at-arms. The
bow, at all events, was in use among the Anglo-Saxons:
it is frequently represented in manuscript illuminations,
and arrow-heads have been found in the graves.
Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 in our Plate are from Kentish interments.
The first two form part of the Fausset collection;
the others, figured in the <i>Nenia Britannica</i>, were
found on Chatham Lines. The whole are of iron. Pictorial
examples of the Anglo-Saxon bow, arrows, and
quiver may be seen in Cotton MSS., Cleop., C. viii.,
Claudius, B. iv., Tiberius, C. vi., and in the fine <i>Prudentius</i>
of the Tenison Library. See also Strutt's <i>Horda</i>,
vol. i. plate <span class="smcap">xvii</span>. Arrow-heads of iron have also been
found in France, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, and
Livonia. Figures 5 and 6 of our Plate are examples from
the cemetery at Selzen in Rhenish Hesse; figs. 7 and 8
from Livonian graves. With the latter was also found
part of a quiver. The AbbÃ© Cochet<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> has engraved and
described specimens found in France, and M. Troyon
notices Swiss examples in his paper in the <i>ArchÃ¦ologia</i>,
vol. xxxv., and Plate <span class="smcap">xvii</span>. Compare also ArchÃ¦ological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a><br /><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Journal, vol. iii. pp. 119, 120. In the Suabian graves at
Oberflacht, bows also were found. See <i>ArchÃ¦ologia</i>, vol.
xxxvi. Among the figures of the ivory carving forming
the cover of the "Prayer-book of Charles the Bald" are
two archers, each holding a leash of barbed arrows;
the arrows very clearly represented. This curious sculpture,
illustrating the lvii<sup>th</sup>. Psalm, (a favourite subject with
the middle-age artists,) has been carefully engraved in
the sixth volume of the <i>Revue ArchÃ©ologique</i>. The original
is in the Imperial Library at Paris.</p>

<p>These were the usual weapons of the Northern nations:
these are seen in their pictures, are named in
their laws, are described in their Sagas, are found in their
graves. But other arms appear to have been of occasional
employment: the mace, the pike, the sling, the
stone-hammer, the "morning-star," the fork, and the bill.
The Mace is seen in the hands of the Anglo-Saxons (as
well as of the Normans) in the Bayeux tapestry; and it
seems not unlikely that those dentated hoops of bronze<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
which have been found both in England and on the Continent
were the heads of similar weapons; for it must
not be forgotten that, even in the "Iron Period," objects
of bronze continued in use. From the inexhaustible
Wace we learn that the "vilains des viles" who joined
Harold's army,&mdash;</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the mace is a weapon of
the most remote antiquity, and is found, almost identical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
in form with those of the Northern nations, among the
monuments of the ancient Egyptians and Assyrians.</p>

<p>The Stone-Hammer appears to have been employed by
the troops of Harold. William of Poictiers says: "Jactant
cuspides ac diversorum generum tela, sÃ¦vissimas
quasque secures, et <i>lignis imposita saxa</i><a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>." Of the Bill,
an example occurs in the fine Anglo-Saxon Benedictional
of Rouen: it closely resembles the common long-handled
hedging-bill of our own day. The Morning-star, an instrument
formed of a ball of metal (sometimes spiked)
attached by a chain to a short staff, after the manner of a
whip, is believed to have been another of the arms of
this period. Dr. BÃ¤hr found the head of one of these in
his Livonian researches; a complete one, of bronze, (here
engraved) was discovered
at Mitau. Professor
Thomsen mentions also a
bronze specimen, in his
account of the Copenhagen
Museum. The
Sling, according to the
opinion of the PÃ¨re Daniel,
was employed by the
Franks in intrenched positions
and beleaguered
towns<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>. This ancient instrument,
which is found
in Egyptian<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> and Assyrian<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> monuments, was certainly
in use among the Anglo-Saxons, whether for warfare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
or the chase alone, it is not easy to determine. The
figure here engraved is that of
David, from the Anglo-Saxon and
Latin Psalter of Boulogne. See
also the slinger in Strutt's <i>Horda</i>,
Plate <span class="smcap">xvii</span>., from Cotton MS.,
Claudius, B. iv., and Plate <span class="smcap">iii</span>.
of Stothard's Bayeux Tapestry.
In the Copenhagen Museum are
sling-stones, "either with a
groove cut round the middle, or
with two grooves cut cross-wise;
having, in the latter case, the shape of a ball somewhat
flattened." It does not appear that the Northern nations
used leaden pellets; as the Greeks and Romans did, inscribing
them with a thunderbolt, or some quaint sentence,
as "Take this."</p>

<p>It will have been observed, from several passages already
cited, that the use of poisoned weapons is imputed
to the Northern tribes of this period. In "Beowulf,"
and elsewhere, we read of poisoned swords, poisoned
arrows, and poisoned daggers; and, however rare may
have been the employment of such terrible ministers, it
does not seem permitted us to deny altogether their
existence. The famous sword of Beowulf,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hrunting nama,"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>had its edge "stained with poisonous twigs." This,
indeed, is the evidence of a poet: but the Salic Law,
as we have seen, speaks of "sagittÃ¦ toxicatÃ¦<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>." And
Gregory of Tours tells us, of Fredegonda: "Fredegundis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
duos cultros ferreos fieri prÃ¦cipit, quos etiam caraxari
profundiÃ¹s et veneno infici jusserat, scilicet si mortalis

the same writer speaks of these poisoned daggers, or
<i>scramasaxi</i>: "Cum cultris validis quos vulgÃ² scramasaxos
vocant, infectis veneno, utraque latera ei feriunt<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>."</p>

<p>Let us now examine, as far as we are enabled to do so,
what was the Teutonic warrior's defensive equipment.
The structure of the Body-armour can only be inferred
from indirect evidences; for the vague terms of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
writers, such as <i>lorica</i> and <i>byrnie</i>, and the rudely conventional
forms of the painters, who indicated a tree by
a cluster of three or four leaves, and a coat-of-fence by a
few circles penned on the parchment or punched on the
bronze, afford us little help in determining with exactness
how the armour-smith achieved his task. It is curious
that the best testimony we obtain is that of the
poets. A simile or an epithet lets in more light than all
the limners and all the historians. It seems clear that
in the earlier days of Northern rule, none but leaders
wore body-armour; but, as years rolled on, and prosperity
increased, the subaltern ranks affected this distinction.
As we have already shewn (page <a href="#Page_38">38</a>), the Ceorl vied with
the Eorl in the richness and completeness of his equipment;
and at length, under the rule of Charlemagne, the
troops of the Count, as we have seen, are <i>all</i> required to
have defensive armour: "Omnis homo de duodecim
mansis, bruniam habeat." Those who had not this
amount of land, clubbed together and furnished amongst
them the panoply in which one of their number went
forth to the host. Was this <i>byrnie</i> of interlinked chain-mail?
The Anglo-Saxon poem of "Beowulf" may throw
some light on the question:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The war-byrnie shone, hard (and) hand-locked (<i>heard hond-locen</i>);
the bright ring-iron sang in their trappings when they proceeded to go
forward to the hall, in their terrible armour."&mdash;<i>Canto</i> i. <i>line</i> 640.</p>

<p>"Beowulf prepared himself, the warrior in his weeds, he cared not
for life: the war-byrnie, twisted with hands (<i>hondum ge-broden</i>), wide
and variegated with colours, was now to try the deep," &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">
<i>Canto</i> xxi. <i>line</i> 2882.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>In Canto xxii. we have,&mdash;"the war-dress, the locked
battle-shirt." ... "On his shoulder lay the twisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
breast-net (<i>breost-net broden</i>) which protected his life
against point and edge." ... "his war-byrnie, his hard
battle-net (<i>here-net hearde</i>)."</p>

<p>If there is meaning in words, surely "the <i>twisted</i>
breast-<i>net</i>," the "hard battle-<i>net</i>," the "<i>locked</i> battle-shirt,"
the "byrnie <i>twisted</i> with hands," the "war-byrnie,
hard and <i>hand-locked</i>," can mean nothing but the hauberk
of interlinked chain-mail; that garment which, we have so
often been told, came to us at some unknown time, from
some unknown people, dwelling in some unknown region
of the East. If this fabric, which, for brevity, we will call
chain-mail, came from the East, where are the eastern
monuments that exhibit it? It is not seen in Egyptian,
Assyrian, nor Indian sculptures or paintings; and the
triumph-scenes of these nations represent in great diversity
the numerous tribes of Asia. The same origin has
been given to Cannon; but every one who has made any
research in this direction knows that the Oriental derivation
of this engine has not the smallest foundation in
fact<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>. In the Volsunga Saga, a work of the eleventh
century, we read that "Sigurd's sides so swelled with
rage that the rings of his byrnie were burst asunder;"
which could scarcely have happened (adds Von Leber,
who notices this passage,) with a garment made of rings
sewn contiguously<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>. The well-known enigma of Bishop
Aldhelm, written in the eleventh century, so curiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
illustrates our inquiry, that we shall be pardoned for reprinting
it. It is headed "De Lorica:"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>A <i>lorica</i> formed of metal, without the aid of any texture
of wool or of silk, could scarcely be anything else
than a coat of chain-mail. We may further refer to
the Bayeux tapestry (Stothard, Plate <span class="smcap">xvi</span>.), where the
<i>pillards</i> are appropriating the armour of the slain. The
last figure in the second border of that plate is stripping
the hauberk over the head of a fallen warrior; and, in
thus turning it inside out, discloses the interior of the
garment, which exhibits the ring-work exactly in the
same manner as it is seen on the outside of others. At
a later period, a similar evidence is afforded by the sculptured
monumental effigies; the overlapping folds of the
hauberk shewing the ring-work on the inside as well as
on the outside. Figures of the thirteenth century in the
Temple Church and in St. Saviour's Church, London,
offer illustrations of this fact. Further instances may be
found at Stowe-Nine-Churches in Northamptonshire, and
at Aston, Warwickshire; and probably no English county
is without similar examples. Compare also the curious
fragment of chain-mail found at Stanwick, Yorkshire, and
now deposited in the British Museum.</p>

<p>The defence made of iron rings, of which Varro attributes
the invention to the Gauls, appears to be no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
other than the hauberk of chain-mail:&mdash;"Lorica a loris,
quod de corio crudo pectoralia faciebant, postea succuderunt
Galli e ferro sub id vocabulum, ex annulis, ferream
tunicam." Whoever may have been the inventors
of this armour, the probability seems to be that it came
into use gradually: from its costliness and rarity, leaders
only could at first obtain it; that, as handicraft improved,
and the efficiency of the defence became acknowledged,
its adoption was extended, and its costliness
diminished. The notion, that in the thirteenth
century the hauberk of chain-mail came suddenly and
generally into use, is against all known precedent, and
contrary to the natural course of human inventions.</p>

<p>Other kinds of body-armour were worn at this time.
Charlemagne, as we have seen, was defended by a kind
of jazerant-work. Ingulphus tells us that Harold, finding
the heavy armour of his troops an incumbrance in
their mountain warfare with the Welsh, clothed them
in a defence of leather only. Something
similar is seen in this figure
from Cotton MS., Cleop., C. viii.</p>

<p>The coat here seems to be of hide,
with the fur left upon it; a dress still
in use among some of the Cossack
soldiers of Russia. Wace appears
to describe this garment, where, recounting
the death of Duke Guillaume
Longue-EspÃ©e by the traitorous
Fauces, he says:&mdash;</p>

antiquity, and of a very wide adoption, was also probably
in vogue; and also coats covered with scale-work;
but these are difficult to be identified in the monuments
of the time. The hauberks of the Anglo-Saxons at the
battle of Hastings are remarked to have been both short
and small:&mdash;</p>

<p>In Anglo-Saxon illuminations, a very large majority of
the fighting men appear to
have no defensive armour at
all but the helmet and shield;
as in this example from a MS.
of <i>Prudentius</i>, of the eleventh
century, in the Tenison Library.
The leg-bands seen on
these figures, and on many
others of the same period,
were in common use among
the soldiery. It is a fashion
of which we find an early example
in the <i>calceus patricius</i>
of the Romans, and a remnant
in the chequered hose of the
Scottish Highlanders. Those of
the Anglo-Saxons were generally
wound round the leg, and
then turned down and fastened
below the knee. Sometimes
they were tied in front; as
may be seen in the Ethelwold
Benedictional; and compare Stothard's Bayeux Tapestry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Plate <span class="smcap">iv</span>. Henry of Huntingdon, who wrote in the beginning
of the twelfth century, gives us incidentally the full
arming of a warrior of the eleventh<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>. When Sigeward,
duke of Northumberland, found death approaching him,
not on the field of battle, but in the peaceful chamber,
he exclaimed: "Quantus pudor me tot in bellis mori
non potuisse, ut vaccarum morti cum dedecore reservarer.
Induite me saltem lorica mea impenetrabili,
prÃ¦cingite gladio, sublimate galea: scutum in lÃ¦va,
securim auratam mihi ponite in dextra, ut militum fortissimus
modo militis moriar. Dixerat: et ut dixerat,
armatus honorifice exhalavit."</p>

<p>In an age when missiles were much in use; javelins,
arrows, and the stones of the mangona and of the
slinger; the soldier would naturally employ his first care
to the arming of his head. Consequently we find in
the monuments of this period that, even when the body
appears to have no defensive covering, the head is carefully
protected by the helmet.</p>

</div>

<p>In the beginning, even the helmet was rare among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
the Teutonic tribes. Tacitus tells us, of the ancient
Germans: "Paucis loricÃ¦, vix uni alterive cassis aut
galea." And Agathias in the seventh century mentions
that few of the Franks had helmets. Leaders,
however, wore them. Dagobert, in a contest with the
Saxons, received a blow which, dividing his casque,
carried away a part of his hair<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>. And when his father,
Clotaire II., came to his relief, this latter prince placed
himself on the bank of the Veser, announcing his arrival
to the Saxon leader by taking off his helmet and displaying
his long locks<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>. In the time of Charlemagne,
as we have seen from his capitularies, the count is required
to furnish troops who are provided with helmets.
The fashion of these headpieces we learn from various
vellum-paintings of a little
later date. We find them
to have been hemispherical,
conical, of the Phrygian form,
combed, and crested: sometimes
of a complicated make,
with a sort of crocketed ridge<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>;
sometimes terminating in a
kind of fleur-de-lis<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>. The
figure here given from Add.
MS., 18,043, a Psalter of the
tenth century, affords a good
example of the combed helmet.
The personage represented is
Goliath; and it may be necessary to add, in order to
understand the girding of the sword, that the warrior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
presents his back to us. In lieu of the combed crest,
the figure of a boar, sacred to the god Freya, was often
placed on the helmets of the pagan Teutons; a practice
which at length became so general, that the word <i>eofor</i>
(boar) was poetically used for the casque itself. Thus,
in "Beowulf:" "He commanded them to bring in the
boar, an ornament to the head, the helm lofty in war:"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"eofor heÃ¡fod-segn<br /></span>
<span class="i1">heaÃ¾o-steÃ¡pne helm," &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Line</i> 4299.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Again: "The white helm covered the hood of mail, ...
surrounded with lordly chains, even as in days of yore
the weapon-smith had wrought it, had wondrously furnished
it, had set it round with the shapes of swine,
that never after brand nor war-knife might have power
to bite it." (l. 2895.)</p>

<p>Here we see the particular object of this device: it
was to act as a holy charm. In Canto 15, the boar
seems also to be implied; and in this instance it is
"fastened to the helm with wires." "About the crest
of the helm, the defence of the head, it held an amulet
fastened without with wires, that the sword, hardened
with scouring, might not violently injure him when the
shield-bearing warrior should go against his foes." Tacitus,
in the <i>Germania</i>, has a passage curiously illustrating
this superstition. The Ã†stii, he says, "Matrem Deum
venerantur: insigne superstitionis, formas aprorum gestant.
Id pro armis omnique tutelÃ¢, securum DeÃ¦ cultorem
etiam inter hostes prÃ¦stat." Mr. Bateman, in
opening a barrow in Derbyshire, was fortunate enough
to meet with one of these Northern helms surmounted
with the boar crest. The casque is made of iron and
horn, with silver-headed rivets. The hog is of iron,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
having eyes of bronze. See Mr. Bateman's "Antiquities
of Derbyshire" for a more full account of this curious
relic<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>. The practice of adorning the helmet with a crest
is of a very high antiquity, and is first observed among
the Asiatics. The Shairetana, first enemies, then allies,
of the Egyptian Pharaohs, "wore a helmet ornamented
with horns, and frequently surmounted by a crest, consisting
of a ball raised upon a small shaft, which is remarkable
from being the <i>earliest instance of a crest</i><a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>."
In the Assyrian monuments, the crested helmet is of
frequent occurrence; the form of the crest being generally
that of a fan, or of a curved horn, or a kind of
crescent, with its cusps turned downwards. See Layard's
"Nineveh and its Remains," for examples of all these.</p>

<p>In addition to the "white" (or polished) helmet named
in a former extract from "Beowulf," we have, at line
5,226, a "brown-coloured" one, (<i>brun-fagne helm</i>). This
may have been of leather,
of iron bearing the stain of
years, or even of bronze. On
several occasions, relics of
bronze have been disinterred
which have every appearance
of being the framework of helmets.
These metal frames&mdash;for
they occur of iron as well
as of bronze&mdash;are presumed
to have been fixed over a
cap of leather. The example
here engraved was found in 1844, on the skull of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
skeleton exhumed on Leckhampton Hill, near Cheltenham.
The material is bronze, but worked very thin. At
the summit is a ring, and on one side appears a portion
of the chain which seems to have fastened it beneath
the chin. The ring may have served to attach a tufted
ornament, or a grelot. A Livonian headpiece, engraved
on Plate <span class="smcap">v</span>. of Dr. BÃ¤hr's work, has a boss at the summit
exactly similar to this, but with the addition of a grelot
fixed to the ring. The bronze fragments found by Sir
Henry Dryden in a grave at Souldern, Oxfordshire,
appear to have formed part of a helmet like that before
us<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>. The example of iron, already noticed, discovered
by Mr. Bateman, is also of framework, though somewhat
differing in pattern from the Leckhampton relic. Another
iron framework helmet, of the thirteenth century,
was found in an old fort in the Isle of Negropont, and
is figured by Hefner in Plate <span class="smcap">lxiii</span>. of his <i>Trachten</i>.
Compare also Plate <span class="smcap">xxxiv</span>., Part ii., of the same book<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>.
The secretum engraved in vol. vii. of the ArchÃ¦ological
Journal, page 305, is of analogous character: as are
also the so-called Spider Helmets, and the "skulls for
hats;" examples of which may be seen in the Tower
Armories. But the most curious illustration of the purpose
of the bronze relic represented in our woodcut, is
the helmet proposed for the Royal Artillery in 1854. The
metal framing of this was identical in arrangement with
the ancient defence; consisting of a hoop encircling the
head and two semicircular bands, crossing each other at
the crown, and surmounted by a metal knob. The metal
in this case was brass, and it did not greatly differ in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
substance from the ancient bronze. The cap beneath
was of felt. In Anglo-Saxon illuminations, it is not unusual
to see headpieces in which bands of gold-colour
traverse a ground of different hue; and it seems not
improbable that these examples may represent the kind
of helmet under consideration. Similar banded casques
occur in the Bayeux tapestry, in the pictures of the
Painted Chamber at Westminster, and in other monuments.
See also ArchÃ¦ol. Journ., vol. xii. p. 9.</p>

<p>The bronze helmet has also been discovered in Scotland.
Dr. Wilson tells us that "part of a rudely-adorned
helmet of bronze was found in Argyleshire<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>." Another
bronze headpiece is preserved in the Copenhagen Museum,
and Professor Thomsen mentions similar ones,
"overlaid with gold." (Manual.)</p>

<p>In book-illuminations of this period the helmet is frequently
coloured yellow, which may either signify bronze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
or gilding. A crown is sometimes added, not in the
case of kings alone, but of distinguished personages
generally. One of the crowned figures in our woodcut,
No. <a href="#i_087.jpg">13</a>, represents the patriarch Abraham. The nasal
appears to have been given to the helmet about the end
of the tenth century: of which an early example is furnished
in the figure of a warrior in Cotton MS., Tiberius,
C. vi. fol. 9, a work of this period. By the middle
of the next century, its adoption has become general, and
in the Bayeux Tapestry it is worn equally by Norman
and Saxon.</p>

<p>To a soldiery with whom body-armour appears to have
been a secondary consideration, the <span class="smcap">Shield</span> would be of
the first consequence. We find, therefore, the Northern
warrior seldom unaccompanied by this useful defence.
Leader and retainer, horseman and foot-soldier,&mdash;all are
equipped with the target. Its form was usually round,
though in the pictures, being seen in profile, it often has
the appearance of an oval. And, as the plump-cheeked
houris of the East were called "moon-faced damsels," so
the round targets of the Teutons were named by the poets
"moony shields." They were convex, and in the centre
was a boss of metal, generally terminating in a button
or in a spike, but sometimes without either. The
spiked shield was no doubt used as an offensive arm.
The buttons are sometimes plated with silver, or tinned,
as are the heads of the rivets remaining in the edge of
the umbo. Across the hollow of the boss was fixed a
handle of wood covered with iron; and by this handle
the shield was held at arm's length, the hand entering
the hollow of the boss: see woodcut, No. <a href="#i_087.jpg">13</a>. In the
Wilbraham Cemetery was found the umbo of a shield to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a><br /><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
which the handle was still attached by its rivets. (See
fig. 10 of our <span class="smcap"><a href="#i_102.jpg">xx</a></span>th plate.) The shield was sometimes
strengthened with strips of iron fixed across the inside;
these strips being prolongations of the handle just described.
Such a shield-handle was found at Envermeu
by the AbbÃ© Cochet, and is figured on Plate <span class="smcap">xvi</span>. of his
work. In this example the handle has a <i>single</i> strip on
each side, running towards the edge of the shield. A
similar one was found in a Merovingian cemetery near
Troyes. In a Frankish grave at LondiniÃ¨res was discovered
a variety of this type, in which the strips proceeding
from the handle were <i>three</i> on each side, radiating
towards the rim. This very curious example is engraved
in the <i>Normandie Souterraine</i>, Plate <span class="smcap">viii</span>. Others were
found in the recent excavations in the Isle of Wight.</p>

<p>The body of the shield was usually of wood; the lime
having a marked preference. Thus, in "Beowulf<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>," the
heroic Wiglaf "seized his shield, the yellow lindenwood"
(<i>geolwe linde</i>). And a spell preserved in Harl.

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Leather was sometimes used in the construction of
shields, as we learn from the Laws of Ã†thelstan, which
forbid the employment of sheepskins for this purpose
under a penalty of thirty shillings. In an example
from the cemetery at Linton Heath, Cambridgeshire, the
leather covering seemed to have been stretched over the
iron umbo as well as over the wooden surface of the
shield<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>. The edge was protected by a rim of metal.
Portions of these rims have been found in the graves,
both in England and on the continent; and as they
present segments of circles, become of use in determining
the shape of the shields themselves. In the
Museum of Schwerin is an example of the metal rim
which is complete: it is circular, and the central boss
is also present.</p>

<p>The oval shield appears in a few examples only. One
was found among the graves explored at Oberflacht,
in Suabia; another is figured by Silvestre, (vol. i.
pl. <span class="smcap">cxliv</span>.) from a Longobardic miniature of the eleventh
century; and a third occurs in the Bayeux Tapestry,
Plate <span class="smcap">xvi</span>. The surface of the Northern shields was
painted in various fanciful devices, sometimes heightened
with gilding. And, as Christianity was embraced
by the various Northern tribes, the cross became a frequent
decoration. The encomiast of Queen Emma, in
describing the fleet of Canute the Great, says: "Erant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
ibi scutorum tot genera, ut crederis adesse omnium populorum
agmina. Si quando sol illis jubar immiscerit
radiorum, hinc resplenduit fulgor armorum, illinc vero
flamma dependentium scutorum<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>."</p>

<p>Among the devices, there is nothing of a heraldic
character, and even as late as the time of the Bayeux
Tapestry, as Stothard has well remarked, "we do not
find any particular or distinguished person twice bearing
the same device<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>."</p>

<p>In the accompanying figure from Cotton MS., Cleopatra,
C. viii., we observe that the
Anglo-Saxon horseman carried
his shield, when not in
use, slung at his back. The
knights of the fourteenth
century carried their helmets
in the same manner, as may
be seen in the fine manuscript
of the <i>Roman du Roi
Meliadus</i>, Additional MSS.,
12,228. Besides the ordinary Northern shields, we sometimes
find them represented of so large a size as to cover
the whole person. In Harleian MS. 2,908, fol. 53, are
two such, but perhaps mere exaggerations of the draughtsman.
Shields of this kind were, however, certainly in
use in the East at an early date, and may be seen in
Egyptian, Assyrian, and Indian monuments<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>.</p>

<p>It has been conjectured that the bronze coatings of
shields which have from time to time been discovered in
this country, and commonly attributed to the Ancient
Britons, may belong to the Anglo-Saxon period: while
we admit this probability, we must not forget that they
have not yet been found in the Anglo-Saxon graves.</p>

<p>The shields placed in the graves were the ordinary "lindens,"
of which no part commonly remains but the metal
boss and handle. The chief varieties of forms offered by
the bosses will be found in our Plates <span class="smcap">xix</span>. and <span class="smcap">xx</span>., figs.
1 to 10; all from English tombs<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>. Similar relics have
been dug up in Scotland; of which No. 11 in our Plate
offers an example. This was procured from a tomb in the
county of Moray, accompanied with fragments of oak and
remains of the hero's horse and its bridle. See Dr. Wilson's
"ArchÃ¦ology of Scotland," to which we are indebted
for this specimen. On the continent similar objects have
been found, differing but slightly from our own examples.
No. 12 is from the cemetery at Selzen, in Rhenish Hesse.
No. 13 is from a Danish tomb. See also the examples given
in Worsaae's Copenhagen Museum, p. 68. The shields
of the Danes appear to have been ornamented with gold
and colours, the favourite hue being red. In SÃ¦mund's
poetical "Edda" we read of a "red shield with a golden
border," and Giraldus de Barri tells us that the Irish
"carried red shields, in imitation of the Danes." Some
of the Danish shields, like the weapons, were inscribed
with runes<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>. In the tumulus opened at Caenby, in Lincolnshire,
believed to have been that of a Danish viking,
part of a wooden shield was procured, ornamented with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
plates of silver and bronze, bearing the serpentine and
scroll patterns so characteristic of this period. These
fragments are engraved in the seventh volume of the
ArchÃ¦ological Journal.</p>

<p>The <i>guige</i> or strap by which the target was occasionally
suspended from the combatant's neck, leaving the hands
free to direct the steed or ply the weapon, appears (at
least during the later days of Saxon rule) to have been
in use among our countrymen, as well as with their Norman
neighbours. Of Harold's nobles, Wace tells us:&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>And in the Bayeux Tapestry, the kite-shield thus fixed
may be seen on the English side.</p>

<p>The place occupied by the shield in the graves of the
Frankish, Germanic, and Scandinavian heroes is by no
means uniform. It has been found on the breast, on the
right arm, upon the knees, and beneath the head. It is
by the position of the umbo in the grave that this fact
has been exactly ascertained. Examples will be found
in the Ozingell Cemetery, in the explorations at Harnham
Hill (<i>ArchÃ¦ologia</i>, vol. xxxv.), in the Selzen find,
in the <i>Normandie Souterraine</i>, and in the account of
the cemetery at Linton Heath (ArchÃ¦ol. Journ., vol. xi.
p. 108).</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Horse furniture</span> of the Northern cavalry appears
to have been usually very simple. By referring to our
engravings, Nos. <a href="#i_093.jpg">16</a> and <a href="#i_104.jpg">21</a>, it will be seen that the
saddle was provided with girth, breastplate, and crupper,
the latter being fixed to the sides of the saddle: pendent
ornaments are attached to the bridle, breastplate, and
crupper. From the poem of "Beowulf" we learn that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
war-horse was occasionally furnished with much costliness:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Then did the Refuge of warriors command eight horses, ornamented
on the cheek, to be brought into the palace: ... on one
of which stood a saddle variegated with work, made valuable with
treasure: that was the war-seat of a lofty king when the son of
Healfdene would perform the game of swords."&mdash;<i>Canto</i> 15.</p></blockquote>

<p>A donation of the Anglo-Saxon king Ethelbert affords
another example:&mdash;"Missurum etiam argenteum, scapton

<p>As it was an occasional practice to bury the horse of
the hero in the same grave with his master, the metal
portions of the fitments have been preserved to our time.
Examples of stirrups may be seen in the <i>Annaler for
Nordisk Oldkyndighed</i>, in Worsaae's Copenhagen Museum,
and in <i>Die GrÃ¤ber der Liven</i>: all these are of a single
piece, having a loop for the attachment of the leather.
The bits are of two kinds,&mdash;snaffles
with rings at the sides, and
snaffles with long cheeks. The
example here given is from a
Kentish barrow opened by the
Earl of Londesborough. A similar one is in the Livonian
collection of the British Museum. Compare also the York
volume of the ArchÃ¦ological Institute, page 29; Worsaae's
Copenhagen Museum, pp. 70, 95 and 96; and
M. Troyon's paper in the <i>ArchÃ¦ologia</i>, vol. xxxv. p. 396,
and Plate <span class="smcap">xviii</span>. The snaffle with cheeks was found
among the Wilbraham relics<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>, and occurs also in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
Selzen Cemetery<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>. A very curious variety, in which the
snaffle is of iron, while the cheeks are of bronze richly
foliated, was discovered in an old fort at Lough Fea, in
Ireland, and is engraved in the third volume of the
ArchÃ¦ological Journal. In a tumulus opened in Denmark
were found the remains of a bridle which had
been covered with thin plates of silver.</p>

<p>A good example of the Anglo-Saxon Saddle, seen
without the rider, occurs in Cotton MS., Claudius, B. iv.;
which has been engraved by Strutt in the <i>Horda</i>. See
also our cut from Cleopatra, C. viii. (page <a href="#Page_77">77</a>) where the
breastplate, crupper, and single girth are very clearly
made out.</p>

<p>The Spur of this period consisted of a single goad,
sometimes of a lozenge form, sometimes a plain spike.
The shanks were straight. The following illustration of
the lozenge goad is from the bronze
monument of Rudolf von Schwaben,
in the Cathedral of Merseburg, a
work of the eleventh century<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>. A
very similar example, dug up in railway
excavations near Nottingham,
has lately been added to the Tower
collection. This is of iron. Compare
the Swiss specimen engraved by M. Troyon in vol.
xxxv. of the <i>ArchÃ¦ologia</i>, Plate <span class="smcap">xvii</span>. This also has a
lozenge goad, but the neck of the spur is much longer.
A Livonian example in the British Museum has the goad
in the form of a plain quadrangular spike. The conical
spike is seen among the Danish relics figured on pages 70<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and 95 of Mr. Worsaae's "Copenhagen Museum." A very
curious variety was found in the excavations of the Anglo-Saxon
cemetery at Linton Heath, and is figured in the
eleventh volume of the ArchÃ¦ological Journal. The
buckles in this specimen, instead of being attached to
the strap, form part of the spur itself; being contrived
at the ends of the shanks.</p>

<p>Among the many curious usages revealed by the examination
of the ancient tombs, not the least singular is
the practice of burying the equestrian warrior with a
single spur. This fact has been noticed, not alone among
the pagan Northmen, but as late as the thirteenth century;
and it does not rest on the doubtful evidence of
careless observers, but has been vouched by the testimony
of skilful and practised archÃ¦ologists. It has been further
remarked that the spur, in all such cases, is attached
to the left heel. M. Troyon, in his excavations in the
Colline de Chavannes, Canton de Vaud<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>, found three
spurs, all of different sizes, which he therefore concludes
"ont appartenu chacun Ã  des cavaliers diffÃ©rents." At
Bel-Air, near Lausanne, this gentleman found an interment
where a single spur had been fixed to the left heel
of the entombed warrior. And in a note to his interesting
memoir on the exploration of the Colline de Chavannes,
he says: "J'ai retrouvÃ© quelquefois des Ã©perons
dans des tombes antiques, mais le mort n'en portait
jamais qu'un seul, qui Ã©tait fixÃ© au pied gauche." The
similar instance which has been noticed in an interment
of the thirteenth century is that recorded in the fourth
volume of the ArchÃ¦ological Journal, page 59. A knight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
of the Brougham family, found buried in the chancel of
the church at Brougham, in Westmoreland, had a single
iron spur "round the left heel." "No spur was found
upon the right heel." This knight presented the further
singularity of having been buried cross-legged<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>.</p>

<p>However highly his steed might be prized by the
Northern warrior, it was not alone in feats of horsemanship
that he was required to excel. The youthful
Grymr, in the old poem of "Karl and Grymr," "as he
grew up, was accustomed to make his sword ruddy in
the warlike play of shields; to climb the mountains;
to wrestle; to play well the game of chess; to study
the science of the stars; to throw the stone; and to
practise such other sports as were held in estimation."</p>

<p>Olaff Trygvason, according to an old Norwegian
chronicle quoted by Pontoppidan, "could climb the
rock of Smalserhorn, and fix his shield on the top;
he could walk round the outside of a boat upon the
oars, while the men were rowing; he could play with
three darts, throwing them into the air alternately,
and always keeping two of them up: he was ambidexter,
and could cast two darts at once with equal
force; and he was so famous a bowman that none could
equal him." At a little later date, Kali, an earl of
the Orkneys, boasts of his acquirements:&mdash;"I know,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
says he, "nine several arts. I am skilful at the game
of chess, I can engrave runic letters, I am expert at
my book, I can handle the tools of the smith, I can
traverse the snow on wooden skates, I excel in shooting
with the bow, I ply the oar with address, I can sing to
the harp, and I compose verses<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>."</p>

<p>Of the <span class="smcap">Standards</span> in use at this period, the notices
that have reached us are neither numerous nor clear. In
Asser's "Life of King Alfred" we read, that the Christian
English gained a signal victory over the pagan Danes in
Devon, slaying their king, and capturing "among other
things, the standard called Raven; and they say that
the three sisters of Hingwar and Hubba, daughters of
Lodobroch, wove that flag and got it ready in one day<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
They say, moreover, that in every battle, wherever that
flag went before them, if they were to gain the victory,
a live crow would appear flying on the middle of the
flag; but if they were doomed to be defeated, it would
hang down motionless. And this was often proved to
be so." (Sub an. 878.) The Danish chronicles and
sagas, however, make no mention of this Raven standard.
Mr. Worsaae ("Danes in England") gives the engraving
of a coin of Anlaf, on which he recognises the national
device, and finds it again in that figure of a bird on one
of the flags of the Bayeux tapestry; "for it is very
natural," he says, "that the Scandinavian vikings, or Normans,
who had achieved such famous conquests under
Odin's Raven, should continue to preserve this sign," &amp;c.</p>

<p>Ancient evidences are not agreed as to the Anglo-Saxon
standard used at the battle of Hastings. William
of Poitiers describes it as "memorabile vexillum
Heraldi, hominis armati imaginem intextam habens ex
auro purissimo." Malmesbury follows him: "vexillum&mdash;quod
erat in hominis pugnantis figura, auro et lapidibus
arte sumptuosa contextum."</p>

<p>In the Bayeux tapestry this design does not appear,
but the old Dragon Standard, derived by the Northern
nations from the Romans. And it will be observed that
the dragon of Harold is not a picture painted on a flag;
but, like the Roman <i>draco</i>, a figure fixed by the head to
a staff, with its body and tail floating away into the air.
Compare the representations on the Trajan and Antonine
columns, and in the Bayeux tapestry. The dragon is
found also among the continental Saxons. Of Witikind
we are told: "Hic arripiens Signum, quod apud eo habebatur
sacrum, leonis atque <i>draconis</i> et desuper aquilÃ¦<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
volantis insignitum effigie<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>," &amp;c. And this device of a
dragon appears to have been in use till at length displaced
by the more exact distinctions of hereditary
heraldry.</p>

<p>The well-known custom mentioned by Plot, of the inhabitants
of Burford, in Oxfordshire, carrying the figure
of a dragon yearly "up and down the town in great
Jollity, to which they added the Picture of a Giant," in
memory of a victory over Ethelbald, king of Mercia, in
which this prince lost his "Banner, whereon was depicted
a Golden Dragon;" seems entitled to greater consideration
than most of the customs of old times. The
Dragon Standard of the Anglo-Saxons is a fact substantiated
by many monuments; and the portraying a vanquished
enemy under the lineaments of a hideous giant,
is a practice which has had the sanction of all times and
all nations.</p>

<p>A very curious kind of flag occurs in the Anglo-Saxon
manuscript of <i>Prudentius</i> in the Tenison Library. It is
suspended from a horizontal bar near the spear-head,
after the manner of a sail looped up to its yard, and
from the side hangs a kind of fringe. It decreases below,
presenting altogether a triangular form, and seems
to be the same object as that figured by Mr. Worsaae,
from a coin of Anlaf, in his "Danes in England."</p>

<p>The celebrated <i>Carrocio</i> or Car Standard of the Italians
appears to have been invented during the war between
the Milanese and the Emperor Conrad, about 1035, by
Heribert, the archbishop of Milan. This car had four
wheels, and was drawn by four yoke of oxen, caparisoned
in red. The chariot itself was red: in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
midst of it was a tall red mast, surmounted by a
golden globe, and bearing the banner of the city:
beneath the banner was a large crucifix, of which
"the extended arms appeared to bless the troops." A
kind of platform in front of the <i>carrocium</i> was occupied
by a company of chosen heroes, elected for its especial
defence; while, on a similar platform behind, the
trumpets of the army contributed by their inspiriting
strains to give confidence to all around. Before leaving
the city, mass was solemnised upon the platform of the
chariot, and not unfrequently a chaplain was assigned to
accompany it into the field of battle, and to give absolution
to the wounded. This device of the Milanese
was soon imitated by others of the Italian cities, and
with all it was held to be in the last degree humiliating
to abandon the <i>carrocio</i> to the enemy<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>. Other origins
have, however, been given to the Car Standard. It has
been attributed to the Saracens; and the monk Egidius
ascribes its invention to the Duke of Louvain, who caused
the banner which had been embroidered by the Queen
of England to be placed in a superb chariot drawn by
four oxen. The Italians have a large balance of evidence
on their side.</p>

<p>Of the various kinds of "<span class="smcap">gyns</span>" in use, the notices
are not very distinct. And a chief source of the vagueness
arises from the circumstance that, as the earliest
chroniclers wrote in Latin, they applied the names of
Roman engines to instruments which probably differed
both in form and principle from their ancient prototypes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Tacitus, indeed, tells us that the barbarians borrowed
these engines from those of the Romans; deserters or
prisoners from whose ranks taught to the Northmen the
art of their construction. But there seems good reason
to believe that the motive principle of the classic periers,
<i>torsion</i>, was no longer in use among the middle-age
engineers: their instruments consisting of a lever furnished
at one extremity with a sling and at the other
with a heavy weight; the sudden liberation of the latter
contributing the force necessary to propel the stone from
the sling. See this subject fully discussed in the second
volume of the <i>Ã‰tudes sur l'Artillerie</i> of the Emperor of
the French; and compare the evidences furnished by
monuments of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, given
in later pages of this work.</p>

<p>In 585, we learn from Gregory of Tours, that the Battering
Ram and the Testudo were employed by the Burgundians
in the siege of Comminges<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>. This Tortoise, or
screen for the propellers of the Ram, is described by the
translator of Vegecius in 1408 under the name of the
"Snayle or Welke<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>:" "For, righte as the snaile hath
his hous over hym where he walkethe or resteth, and oute
of his hous he shetethe his hede whan he wolle, and
draweth hym inne a-yene, so doth this gynne." In the
ninth century we obtain considerable light on this subject
from the curious description of the Siege of Paris,
written in Latin verse by Abbo, a monk of St. Germain-des-Prez,
who was an eye-witness of the events he records.
He names the Musculus and the Pluteus, both
of which were contrivances to shelter the besiegers while
at work; the Balista and Mangana, machines for casting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
large stones; the Catapulta, which cast both stones and
darts; the Terebra, a spiked beam for boring into the
walls; and the Falarica, a gyn throwing darts to which
burning substances were affixed; a terrible instrument
in those days, when the roofs of houses were almost invariably
covered with thatch.</p>

<p>The Moveable Towers formed of wood, in imitation of
those of the Romans, and placed by the walls of city or
castle in order to bring the assailants to a level with the
defenders, are first mentioned in medieval annals under
the eleventh century; but they play no conspicuous part
in the military history of these days till the succeeding
century, when their employment appears to have been
frequent. In 1025, Eudes, comte de Chartres, is said to
have used the Moveable Tower in besieging the Castle of
Montbrol, near Tours; and so high was it, that it overtopped
the keep-tower of the fortress<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>.</p>

<p>In the east of Europe, the Greek Fire had been known
as early as the year 673; when, according to the historians
of the Lower Empire, Callinicus, the philosopher,
taught the use of it to the Greeks. He himself had probably
derived the knowledge of this composition from the
Arabians; for, though powder acting by <i>detonation</i> (and
consequently cannon) appears to have been first produced
in Europe, and that not earlier than the beginning of the
fourteenth century, the Asiatics had the use of powder
that would <i>fuse</i> at a very early date. The Greek Fire
was discharged from tubes, which could be turned in any
direction. The Princess Anna Comnena, in the <i>Alexiad</i>,
describes its use, as it was employed by the Emperor
Alexis against the Pisans, from tubes fixed at the prow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
of his vessels:&mdash;"They (the Pisans) were astonished to
see fire, which by its nature ascends, directed against
them, at the will of their enemy, downwards and on each
side." The receipt for the composition of the Greek Fire
may be found in the Treatise of Marcus Grecus. The
terrors of these early fire-mixtures were enhanced by the
belief that not only they, but the flames kindled by
them, were inextinguishable by water: "de quibus fit
incendarium quod ab aqua non extinguitur<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>." The Greek
Fire did not, however, reach the west of Europe till a
much later period. It was objected against its use, that
such an agent was contrary to the spirit of religion and
the nobleness of chivalry: it was felt that a weapon
which could be used alike by the weak and the strong,
by the humble and the powerful, might become a dangerous
rival to the knightly lance and panoply.</p>

<h5>FROM THE NORMAN CONQUEST OF ENGLAND TO THE END OF
THE TWELFTH CENTURY.</h5>


<p>For the period now to be examined, namely, from about
the year 1066 to the close of the twelfth century, our
chief evidences are still the illuminations of manuscripts,
the writings of chroniclers and poets, tapestry-pictures,
ivory carvings and metal chasings. The valuable testimonies
of the graves are lost to us; but a new source of
information is opened to our inquiries in the royal and
baronial seals, which from the second half of the eleventh
century appear in great abundance wherever the feudal
system is in vogue. Among these various evidences,
there are two which, for our particular purpose, are especially
valuable,&mdash;the Bayeux tapestry and the Chronicle
of Robert Wace. There seems to be no reasonable doubt
of this tapestry having been embroidered at the close of
the eleventh century; and whoever has carefully examined
it, will be at once convinced that it was wrought,
not by courtly ladies, but by the ruder hands of the
ordinary tapestry-workers. Curious analogy is found in
the decorations of <i>subsellÃ¦</i> of a somewhat later date<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
The especial value of the Chronicle of the Dukes of Normandy
is in the minuteness with which Wace delights
to describe the incidents of knightly achievement. Taking
his crude facts from William of JumiÃ¨ges and Dudo of
St. Quentin, he fills up their outlines with unwearying
elaboration. Not content with drily noting the gathering
of a host or the issue of an onslaught, he tells us how
the levies came into the camp "by twos, and by threes,
and by fours, and by fives," and with what weapons they
contended, the material of their staves, and the length
and breadth of their blades. He himself lived so near
the time of which he writes, and the changes in the interval
were so few, that his descriptions have, in most
instances, the exactness of those of an eye-witness. The
incidents of Duke William's Conquest of England he
learns from the lips of his own father, who lived probably
in the eleventh century:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i25"><i>Roman de Rou</i>, l. 11564.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>We must still, however, keep in view that Wace, like all
writers and illuminators of the middle-ages, does not
hesitate to fill up his pictures from the scenes around
him; so that, while we concede him a large measure of
authority, especially for the events near his own time,
we must on some occasions withhold our confidence,
when his testimony is not in accordance with evidence
which is strictly cotemporary.</p>

<p>With the feudal system was introduced a scheme of
military rank which was altogether distinct from social
position. Esquire, knight, and banneret had no necessary
connection with prince, baron, or private person. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
heir of a crown might be but an esquire; a fortunate
soldier often became a knight. The esquire was the
aspirant to knightly honours, and patiently served his
apprenticeship to arms in the court of his prince or
the hall of some neighbouring baron. At the age of
twenty-one he was eligible to knighthood: he became, if
he had property enough to support the dignity, a knight-bachelor:
"s'il a bien de quoi maintenir l'estat de chevalerie;
car aultrement ne lui est honneur, et vault
mieulx estre bon escuyer que ung poure chevalier<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>." In
the field, the knight's contingent was led under a Pennon,
a flag that differed from the square Banner of the
banneret in being pointed at the fly. The dignity of
the Knight Banneret required a retinue of at least fifty
men-at-arms with their followers, so that it could only be
enjoyed by the rich. The chronicles of the middle-ages
are full of examples in which the knight who has distinguished
himself on the field of battle declines this
dignity on the plea of inadequate funds. When accepted,
the Pennon of the knight was often at once converted on
the spot into a Banner; as in the instance recorded by
Olivier de la Marche:&mdash;"Si bailla le Roi d'Armes (de la
Toison d'Or) un couteau au Duc (de Bourgogne), et prit
le pennon en ses mains, et le bon Duc, sans oster le gantelet
de la main senestre, fit un tour autour de sa main
de la queue du pennon, et de l'autre main coupa ledit
pennon et demeura quarrÃ©; et la Banniere faite<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>."
Froissart offers several similar instances.</p>

<p>The feudal Levy was conducted on the very simple
principle, that they who held the land should defend the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
land, and contribute to the king's army in proportion to
the extent of their holdings. Those who could not serve
in person, as clerics and ladies, were bound to furnish
substitutes. The various contingents due from the vassals
were carefully recorded in rolls; and in the <i>Milice
FranÃ§aise</i> of PÃ¨re Daniel is preserved a curious note of
such a roll, of the time of Philippe Auguste, in which
the contributors to the host are arranged in the following
order: archbishops, bishops, abbots, dukes, earls, barons,
castellans, vavassors, knights-banneret, and knights<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>.
The usual time of service at this period was forty days:
any further attendance was voluntary, and was probably
much dependent on the prospect of booty.</p>

<p>That knight and esquire were not necessarily of gentle
blood, might be proved by numerous ancient evidences:
one or two may suffice. Matthew Paris, under the year
1250, tells us that the king "gave a charter of the
liberty of warren in the land of Saint Alban's to a certain
knight named Geoffry, although not descended from
noble or knightly ancestors." This knight had obtained
the privilege "from having married the sister of the
king's clerk, John Maunsell." The "lady's name was
Clarissa, and she was the daughter of a country priest,
but exalted herself in her pride above her station, to the
derision of all." Froissart, in the fourteenth century,
gives us the history of Jacques le Gris, the bosom-friend
of the Earl of AlenÃ§on,&mdash;"qui n'Ã©toit pas de trop haute
affaire, mais un Ã©cuyer de basse lignÃ©e qui s'Ã©toit avancÃ©,
ainsi que fortune en avance plusieurs; et quand ils sont
tous Ã©levÃ©s et ils cuident Ãªtre au plus sÃ»r, fortune les<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>

eus de commencement<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>."</p>

<p>In fact, numerous exceptional cases might be adduced
on almost every point of knightly usage, and to chronicle
the whole would be a labour of many pages. A detail of
such usages (the education of the varlets, the probation
of the knights, the ceremonies of investiture, and the
institutions of the various brotherhoods) is by no means
within the province of this work. A large amount of
information on these points will be found in the <i>MÃ©moires
sur l'ancienne Chevalerie</i> of St. Palaye, and in the various
works of Ducange; from whose pages numerous references
will lead the more critical investigator to a wide
range of valuable authorities. An able sketch of the
Feudal System, as it existed in Italy, appears in the first
volume of Sismondi's <i>RÃ©publiques Italiennes au Moyen-Ã¢ge</i>,
p. 80, sq.</p>

<p>Besides the feudal troops already noticed, there was a
more general levy, when any pressing danger menaced
the state. Thus, in 1124, Louis le Gros met the threatened
invasion of the Emperor Henry V. by raising an
army of more than 200,000 men<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>. And under Philippe
le Bel, we have an ordinance calling upon all his subjects,
"noble and non-noble, of whatsoever condition
they be, between the ages of eighteen and sixty," to be
ready to take the field. A similar provision was found
in England. The <i>Posse ComitatÃ»s</i>, which was under the
command of the sheriffs of the various counties, included
every freeman capable of bearing arms between the ages
of fifteen and sixty. In 1181, Henry II. fixed an assize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
of arms, by which all his subjects, being freemen, were
bound to be in readiness for the defence of the realm,
"Whosoever holds one knight's fee shall have a coat-of-fence
(<i>loricam</i>), a helmet (<i>cassidem</i>), a shield, and a
lance; and every knight as many coats, helmets, shields,
and lances, as he shall have knights' fees in his domain.
Every free layman, having in rent or chattels the value
of sixteen marks, shall have a coat-of-fence, helmet,
shield and lance. Every free layman having in chattels
ten marks, shall have a haubergeon (<i>halbergellum</i>), iron
cap and lance (<i>capelet ferri et lanceam</i>). All burgesses
and the whole community of freemen shall have each a
'wambais,' iron cap, and lance. On the death of any
one having these arms, they shall remain to his heir.
Any one having more arms than required by this assize,
shall sell or give them, or so alienate them, that they
may be employed in the king's service. No Jew shall
have in his custody any coat-of-fence or haubergeon
(<i>loricam vel halbergellum</i>), but shall sell it or give it, or
in other manner so dispose of it that it shall remain to
the king's use. No man shall carry arms out of the
kingdom, or sell arms to be so carried. None but a
freeman to be admitted to take the oath of arms (<i>et prÃ¦cepit
rex, quod nullus reciperetur ad sacramentum armorum
nisi liber homo</i><a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>)." In this curious document it will be
remarked that the old national weapon, the axe, is altogether
omitted; and the bow, which afterwards became
so effective an arm among the infantry of this country,
is equally unnoticed. The extensive levy indicated in
these passages was clearly that of the so-called <i>ArriÃ¨re-ban</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the <i>Milice des Communes</i>, or <i>Communitates Parochiarum</i>;
troops who marched under the banners of their
respective parishes. For in an ordinance of Charles VI.
of France, in 1411, we find the <i>ban</i> and <i>arriÃ¨re-ban</i> very
exactly defined:&mdash;"Mandons et convoquons par devant
nous, tous noz hommes et vassaulx tenant de nous, tant
en fiefs qu'en arriÃ¨re-fiefs: et aussi des gens des bonnes
villes de notre royaume qui out accoustumÃ© d'eulx armer
par forme et maniÃ¨re de arriÃ¨re-ban<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>."</p>

<p>As the vassals were not always disposed to exchange
hawk and hound for lance and destrier, and as kings
found themselves but ill-served by barons who had become
almost as powerful as themselves, a plan was devised,
by which both were relieved from this embarrassment
of feudal relations. The vassal compounded by a
money-payment called Scutage for the service due to
his lord; and the lord, with the proceeds of this shield-tax,
obtained the aid of foreign soldiery. Henry II.
in England, and Philip Augustus in France, employed
these mercenaries, who were called Coterelli, Rutarii,
Bascli, and Brabantiones, names derived from their
condition or country<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>. William the Conqueror, Wace
tells us, had mercenary troops mixed with his feudal
followers:&mdash;</p>

<p>Besides the troops enumerated above, the King's Body-guard
became a corps of some celebrity at the close of
the twelfth century. Philip Augustus is said to have
instituted this corps in the Holy Land, to protect his
person from the machinations of the Old Man of the
Mountain; and in imitation of his ally, Richard of
England embodied a similar force. The <i>Servientes armorum,
Sergens d'armes</i>, or <i>Sergens Ã  maces</i>, were armed
<i>cap-Ã -pie</i>, and besides their distinctive weapon, the mace,
carried a bow and arrows<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>, and of course a sword. In the
fourteenth century they had a lance<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>. In the beginning
of the fifteenth century, as we learn from the curious
incised stones<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> formerly placed in the church of their
brotherhood, St. Catherine-du-val, at Paris, and now preserved
in the Church of St. Denis, the <i>sergens d'armes</i>
were still clad in complete armour, their weapons being
a mace and sword. The number of these guards at
their first institution is not clear, but in the time of
Louis VI. of France they were <i>reduced</i> to a hundred.
It must be borne in mind that the name of <i>serviens</i> or
<i>sergent</i>, as applied to military persons, had a much
wider signification than this of a body-guard. It often
included all beneath the dignity of a knight.</p>

<p>The Archers in the army of William the Conqueror
fulfilled those duties of preliminary fight which at a
later period fell to the lot of the musquetiers, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
our own day have passed to the cannonier. The Norman
bowmen are the first of the invading troops to set
foot on English soil:&mdash;</p>

<p>From this curious passage it appears that the archers of
William were not a particular and distinctly organized
corps, but that <i>all the foot</i> were armed with the bow.
The caps and boots are clearly portrayed in the Bayeux
tapestry; and from this valuable monument we obtain
an exact confirmation of the statement of Wace, that
some of the archers were clad in armour. See Plate <span class="smcap">xiii</span>.
We must observe also, that the advantage of a close
formation was thoroughly appreciated at this day. The
serried order of the foot noted above was also adopted
by the cavalry:&mdash;</p>

<p>In Plate <span class="smcap">xiii</span>. of the Bayeux tapestry, we find an archer
who carries his quiver, not "el lez pendu," but slung at
his back, so that the arrows present themselves at the
right shoulder. In Plate <span class="smcap">xvi</span>. we have a mounted
archer joining a group of knights in the chase of the
discomfited Saxons; from which we may venture to
infer, that on the rout of an enemy it was the practice
of such bowmen as could obtain horses, to act with the
cavalry in the pursuit of the flying foe.</p>

<p>In the south, military science was already so far advanced
that a Code for the discipline of troops had been
established. The rules laid down by the Emperor Frederic
for the control of his army in Italy in 1158, have been
preserved by Radevicus of Frisinga<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>, and are given by
Sismondi<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>.</p>

<p>Wherever the feudal system had taken root, a similar
arming and similar tactics prevailed. The military</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Chevals quistrent et armes Ã  la guise franchoise,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Quer lor semblout Ã¨ plus riche Ã¨ plus cortoise."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But in the border-nations of Europe, where the old
liberties of Celt and Teuton still lingered, the fashions
of war were very different. In Ireland, in Scotland, in
Wales, and in the Scandinavian North, the heroes were
by no means clad in the pattern of the Bayeux tapestry.
From Giraldus Cambrensis we learn that the Irish in the
twelfth century wore no body-armour. In riding they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
used neither saddle nor spur. Their shields were circular,
and painted red. Helmets they had none. Their
weapons were a short spear, javelins, and an axe. The
axes, which they had derived from the Norwegians and
Ostmen, were excellently well steeled. "They make
use of but one hand when they strike with the axe,
extending the thumb along the handle to direct the
blow; from which neither the helmet can defend the
head, nor the iron folds of the armour the body; whence
it has happened in our time that the whole thigh of a
soldier, though cased in well-tempered armour, hath been
lopped off by a single blow, the limb falling on one side
of the horse, and the expiring body on the other. They
are also expert beyond all other nations in casting stones
in battle, when other weapons fail them, to the great
detriment of their enemies<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>." The bow not being in
use among the Irish of this time, and consequently there
being nothing to oppose to the distant attack of the
Norman archers, the havoc made by these latter troops
was terrific; so that Giraldus, in his chapter, "Qualiter
Hibernica gens sit expugnanda," recommends that in all
attacks upon them, bowmen should be mixed with the
heavy-armed force.</p>

<p>The Welsh also retained their old mode of warfare:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Gens Wallensis habet hoc naturale per omnes<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Indigenas, primis proprium quod servat ab annis,"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>says Guillaume le Breton. "They are lightly armed,"
writes Giraldus Cambrensis, "so that their agility may
not be impeded; they are clad in haubergeons (<i>loricis</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
<i>minoribus</i>), have a handful of arrows, long lances, helmets,
and shields, but rarely appear with iron greaves
(<i>ocreis ferreis</i>). Fleet and generous steeds, which their
country produces, bear their leaders to battle, but the
greater part of the people are obliged to march on foot
over marshes and uneven ground. Those who are
mounted, according to opportunity of time and place,
both for the retreat and advance, easily become infantry.
Those of the foot-soldiers who have not bare feet, wear
shoes made of raw hide, sewn up in a barbarous fashion.
The people of Gwentland are more accustomed to war,
more famous for valour, and more expert in archery,
than those of any other part of Wales. The following
examples prove the truth of this assertion. In the last
assault of Abergavenny Castle, which happened in our
days, two soldiers passing over a bridge to a tower built
on a mound of earth, in order to take the Welsh in the
rear, their archers, who perceived them, discharged their
arrows, penetrating an oaken gate which was four fingers
thick: in memory of which deed, the arrows are still
preserved sticking in the gate, with their iron piles seen
on the other side.... Their bows are made of wild elm,
unpolished, rude, and uncouth, but strong; not calculated
to shoot an arrow to a great distance, but to inflict
very severe wounds in closer fight<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>." Guillaume le
Breton, in describing the Welsh troops who accompanied
Richard C&#339;ur-de-Lion into France, deprives them
of defensive armour altogether:&mdash;</p>

<p>But he allows them a greater variety of weapons on this
occasion than is found in the account of Giraldus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Clavam cum jaculo, venabula, gesa, bipennem,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Arcum cum pharetris, nodosaque tela vel hastam."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The <i>gesa</i> of this passage is the often-mentioned <i>guisarme</i>.
The <i>nodosa tela</i> is not so clear, but may have been a
dart with a ball at the end; the object of which ball
was to arrest the javelin when, sliding through the
hand, it had inflicted its wound, so that it might be
employed afresh. Such weapons were used by the
ancient Egyptians<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>, and are still employed in the manner
mentioned above by the Nubians and Ababdeh.</p>

<p>Hoveden, describing the battle of Lincoln in 1141, and
the disposition of the Earl of Chester's army, says: "On
the flank, there was a great multitude of Welshmen,
better provided with daring than with arms."</p>

<p>In Scotland, two leading influences were at work.
The highlanders adhered to their old habits and their
old arms with a pertinacity which has not been extinguished
even in our own day. The round shield ornamented
with knot-work subsisted to the field of Culloden,
and the dagger with its hilt of the same pattern, is
still in vogue. But in the south of Scotland the fashions
of France and of England had made great inroads; especially
advanced by the crowds of discontented nobles of
Saxon and of Norman blood, who sought in the court of
the Scottish king solace for their misfortunes, or revenge
for their wrongs. Thus in the seal of Alexander I.
(1107-1124,)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
we find that monarch wearing the hauberk with tunic and
the nasal helmet, and armed with lance and kite-shield,
exactly as seen in the monuments of his more southern
cotemporaries. This equipment, however, was only found
among the leaders of their hosts, and even they did not
always think fit to adopt the new fashion. Thus, at the
battle of the Standard, in 1138, the Earl of Strathearne
exclaims:&mdash;"I wear no armour, yet they who do will
not advance beyond me this day."</p>

</div>

<p>This Battle of the Standard, so called from the <i>Carrocium</i>,
or Car-standard, which was brought into the field
by the English, affords us a good insight into the warfare
of the Scots of this day. Let us remember, however, that
it is an English chronicler who records the fight. Roger
of Hoveden tells us that the bishop<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> who accompanied
the English army, addressing the troops previous to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
engagement, said of the Scots: "They know not how to
arm themselves for battle; whereas you, during the time
of peace, prepare yourselves for war, in order that in
battle you may not experience the doubtful contingencies
of warfare.... But now, the enemy <i>advancing in disorder</i>,
warns me to close my address, and rushing on
<i>with a straggling front</i>, gives me great reason for gladness."
At the end of his speech, "all the troops of the
English answered, 'Amen, Amen.'"</p>

<p>"At the same instant the Scots raised the shout of
their country, and the cries of 'Albany, Albany!' ascended
to the heavens. But the cries were soon drowned
in the dreadful crash and the loud din of the blows.
When the ranks of the Men of Lothian, who had obtained
from the king of Scotland, though reluctantly on
his part, the glory of striking the first blow, hurling
their darts and presenting their lances of extraordinary
length, bore down upon the English knights
encased in armour, striking, as it were, against a
wall of iron, they found them impenetrable. The
archers of King Stephen, mingling among the cavalry,
poured their arrows like a cloud upon them, piercing
those who were not protected by armour. Meanwhile
the whole of the Normans and English stood in one
dense phalanx around the standard, perfectly immoveable.
The chief commander of the Men of Lothian fell
slain, on which the whole of his men took to flight.
On seeing this, the main body of the Scots, which was
contending with the greatest valour in another part of
the field, was alarmed and fled. Next, the king's
troop, which King David had formed of several clans,
as soon as it perceived this, began to drop off: at first,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
man by man, afterwards in bodies; the king standing
firm, and being at last left almost alone. The king's
friends seeing this, forced him to mount his horse and
take to flight. But Henry, his valiant son, not heeding
the example of his men, but solely intent on glory and
valour, bravely charged the enemy's line, and shook it
by the wondrous vigour of his onset. For his troop
was the only one mounted on horseback, and consisted
of <i>English and Normans who formed a part of his father's
household</i>. His horsemen, however, were not long able
to continue their attacks against soldiers on foot, cased
in armour, and standing immoveable in close and dense
ranks; but, with their lances broken, and their horses
wounded, were compelled to fly. Rumour says that
many thousands of the Scots were slain on that field,
besides those who, being taken in the woods and standing
corn, were put to death. Accordingly, the English
and Normans happily gained the victory, and with a
very small effusion of blood." The standard which gave
to this battle of Cuton Moor its popular name, was
formed of a mast placed on a car, having at its summit
a silver pix containing the Host, and beneath, three
banners, those of St. Peter, St. John of Beverley, and
St. Wilfrid of Ripon.</p>

<p>The equipment of the Scandinavian heroes in the twelfth
century has come down to us in several cotemporary
writings. The author of the <i>Speculum Regale</i>, an Icelandic
chronicle of this period, instructs his son in his
military duties: when combating on foot, he is to wear
his heavy armour, namely, a byrnie, or thick panzar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
(<i>thungann pannzara</i>), a strong shield (<i>skiold</i>) or buckler
(<i>buklara</i>), and a heavy sword. For naval actions the
best weapons are long spears, and for defence, panzars
made of soft and well-dyed linen cloth, together with
good helmets (<i>hialmar</i>), pendant steel caps (<i>hangandi
stÃ¡lhufur</i>), and broad shields<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>. The directions for a
knight's equipment are more minute: Let the horseman
use this dress: first, hose made of soft and well-prepared
linen cloth, which should reach to the breeches-belt
(<i>broka-belltis</i>); then, above them, good mail-hose
(<i>bryn-hosur</i>), of such a height that they may be fastened
with a double string. Next, let him put on a good
pair of breeches (<i>bryn-brÃ¦kur</i>), made of strong linen;
on which must be fastened knee-caps made of thick
iron and fixed with strong nails. The upper part of
the body should first be clothed in a soft linen panzar
(<i>blautann panzara</i>), which should reach to the middle
of the thigh; over this a good breast-defence (<i>briost
biorg</i>), of iron, extending from the bosom to the breeches
belt; above that a good byrnie, and over all a good
panzar of the same length as the tunic, but without
sleeves. Let him have two swords,&mdash;one girded round
him, the other hung at his saddle-bow; and a good
dagger (<i>bryn-knif</i>). He must have a good helm, made
of tried steel, and provided with all defence for the face
(<i>met allri andlitz biaurg</i>); and a good and thick shield
suspended from his neck, especially furnished with a
strong handle. Lastly, let him have a good and sharp
spear of tried steel furnished with a strong shaft<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>. It
will be remarked that the body is here clothed in four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
different garments, one over the other; which appear to
be the <i>tunic</i>, reaching to mid-thigh; the breast-defence
of iron (whether formed in a single piece, or of several
smaller plates, does not appear); the <i>hauberk</i> of the
chain-mail, and the <i>gambeson</i>, a quilted coat, made in
this instance without sleeves. Besides the weapons
named above, the axe was still in favour among the
Northern warriors. By the ancient laws of Helsingia,
every youth on attaining the age of eighteen, was bound
to furnish himself with five kinds of warlike equipment:
a sword, an axe, a helmet (<i>jernhatt</i>), a shield, and a
byrnie or a gambeson. A spirited passage of Giraldus
Cambrensis brings the Norwegian troops vividly before
us. Describing their attack upon Dublin, about 1172,
he has: "A navibus igitur certatim erumpentibus, duce
Johanne, agnomine <i>the wode</i>, quod Latine sonat insano
vel vehementi, viri bellicosi Danico more undique ferro
vestiti, alii loricis longis, alii laminis ferreis arte consutis,
clipeis quoque rotundis et rubris, circulariter ferro
munitis, homines tam animis ferrei quÃ m armis, ordinatis
turmis, ad portam orientalem muros invadunt."
The round painted shields edged with metal will bring
to remembrance the similar defences of the Anglo-Saxons;
and in the laminated cuirass we see another
instance of the <i>jazerant</i> armour worn by Charlemagne.
In King Sverrer's <i>Saga</i>, written towards the close of the
twelfth century, by the abbot of Thingore in Iceland, and
others, from the narrative of the king himself, we have
a curious passage: "Sverrer was habited in a good
byrnie, above it a strong gambeson (<i>panzara</i>), and over
all a red surcote (<i>raudan hiup</i><a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>). With these he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
a wide steel hat (<i>vida stÃ¡lhufu</i>), similar to those worn by
the Germans; and beneath it a mail cap (<i>brynkollu</i>), and
a 'panzara-hufu.' By his side hung a sword, and a
spear was in his hand<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>." From this description it seems
clear that those singular broad-rimmed helmets found
occasionally in monuments of the twelfth, thirteenth, and
fourteenth centuries, and more frequently in later times;
of which examples occur among the sculptures of the tomb
of Aymer de Valence, in Westminster Abbey, and on the
great seal of Henry III., king of Spain; were introduced
into the north and west of Europe through Germany;
the Germans, on their part, probably deriving
them from the Italians; to whom this form of headpiece
had come down from the well-known <i>petasus</i> of classic
times. The <i>panzara-hufu</i> was probably a quilted coif
worn under the steel hat. Compare Willemin, vol. i.,
Plate <span class="smcap">cxliii</span>.; and see our woodcut, No. <a href="#i_265.jpg">56</a>.</p>

<p>The Prussians in the twelfth century differ but little
in their appearance from the Anglo-Saxon warrior of the
preceding age. They wear the tunic, reaching to the
knees, and belted at the waist; but, in lieu of leg-bands,
have tight hose. They have spears little exceeding
their own height, and the shield they carry is a
mean between the kite and the pear-shape. We derive
these particulars from the curious figures of the bronze
doors of Gnesen Cathedral, given by Mr. Nesbitt in the
ninth volume of the ArchÃ¦ological Journal, (p. 345);
the subject represented being the Legend of Saint Adalbert.
Hartknoch (<i>De Rebus Prussicis</i>) tells us that the
arms of the Prussians were clubs, swords, arrows, spears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
and shields, and their dress consisted of a short tunic
of linen or undyed woollen cloth, tight linen chausses
reaching to the heels, and shoes of raw hide or bark.</p>

<p>Throughout the period which we are now investigating,
the Clergy not unfrequently appear in knightly
equipment at siege and battle. But in order to avoid
an infringement of <i>the letter</i> of the canons, which forbade
them to stain their hands with human blood, they
armed themselves with the mace or bÃ¢ton. At the battle
of Hastings, Odo, bishop of Bayeux,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Un haubergeon aveit vestu<br /></span>
<span class="i1">De sor une chemise blanche:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">LÃ© fut li cors, juste la manche.<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Tote la gent le congnoisseit:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Un baston teneit en son poing."&mdash;<i>Rom. de Rou</i>, l. 13254.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the disorders of Stephen's reign, the prelates appear
to have been still more frequently trespassers on
the canons of the Church; for the author of the <i>Gesta
Stephani</i> exclaims, "The bishops, the bishops themselves,
I blush to say it,&mdash;not all of them, but many,
bound in iron, and completely furnished with arms,
were accustomed to mount war-horses with the perverters
of their country, to participate in their prey."
Everyone will remember the answer attributed to
Richard C&#339;ur-de-Lion, who, when the pope required
him to release from captivity his spiritual "son," the
bishop of Beauvais, sent back the hauberk in which the
prelate had been taken, adding, in the words of the
history of Joseph: "This have we found: know now
whether it be thy son's coat or no." The monk of St.
Edmund's, Jocelin of Brakelond, tells us under the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
1193: "Our abbot, who was styled 'the Magnanimous
Abbot,' went to the siege of Windsor, where he appeared
in armour, with <i>other abbots</i> of England, having
his own banner, and retaining many knights at heavy
charges; being more remarkable there for his counsel
than for his piety. But we cloister-folks thought this
act rather dangerous, fearing the consequence, that some
future abbot might be compelled to attend in person on
any warlike expedition."</p>

<p>On other occasions, however, the clergy fulfilled in
the field duties more in harmony with their peaceful
calling,&mdash;attending the wounded or consoling the dying.
At the battle of Hastings, the Norman priests gathered
together on a hillock, where, during the contest, they
offered up prayers for their companions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Li proveire Ã¨ li ordenÃ©<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Por Dex prÃ©ier Ã¨ por orer."&mdash;<i>Wace</i>, l. 13081.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And frequent injunctions forbade these holy men from
joining in military exploits. Among the decrees of the
synod of Westminster, promulgated in 1175, we read:
"Whoever would appear to belong to the clergy, let
them not take up arms, nor yet go about in armour.
If they despise this injunction, let them be mulcted with
the loss of their proper rank<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>."</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">tactics</span> of this period are pretty clearly exemplified
by the proceedings of Duke William at the field of
Hastings. The army was divided into three corps:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Normanz orent treiz cumpaignies,<br /></span>

</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>
<p>The hired troops were placed in the first division, to
bear the brunt of the fight:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>The charge of the horse, as is well known, was preceded
by the feat of Taillefer, to whom the duke had
accorded the privilege of striking the first blow. The
charge of the knights was at this time, and long after,
made in a single line, or <i>en haie</i>, as it was called; the
attack in squadrons being a much later practice. The
Normans acted against their opponents as well by the
weight of the horse as by dint of weapons. One knight&mdash;</p>

<p>In the crusades, the European knights occasionally,
though very rarely, contended on foot; and the Princess
Anna Comnena remarks that the French men-at-arms,
so terrible on horseback, are little dangerous when dismounted<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>.</p>

<p>To disorder the enemy's ranks by a simulated flight
appears to have been a favourite stratagem of the Normans.
Duke William Sans-peur used this device against
the Germans before Rouen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<span class="i38"><i>Wace</i>, l. 3972.<br /></span>

<p>The similar incident of the battle of Hastings is in the
recollection of all:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<span class="i1">E de fuir semblant fereient."&mdash;<i>Line</i> 13311.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Another device of Duke William on this eventful day
was to assail the English by a downward flight of arrows,
for he had found that the shields of his opponents
had secured them from the effects of a direct attack:
"Docuit etiam dux Willielmus viros sagittarios ut non
in hostem directe, sed in aÃ«ra sursum sagittas emitterent
cuneum hostilem sagittis cÃ¦carent: quod Anglis magno
fuit detrimento<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>."</p>

<p>War-cries were still in vogue, and saintly relics and
emblems were regarded with a veneration commensurate
with the power of the Church and the confiding credulity
of the soldiery. The sacred symbol of the Cross is
seen constantly on the shields of the knights; and one
of the barons of Rufus, on departing for the Crusades,
tells the king that his shield, his helmet, his saddle, and
his horses, shall all be marked with this holy device<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>.
It was even found useful to enrol mock-saints in the
armies contending against the enemies of the faith.
Thus, in the contest between the Saracens in Sicily
and Count Roger, about the year 1070, Saint George
mounted on a white horse is seen to issue from the
Christian ranks, and head the onslaught on the unbelievers:&mdash;"Apparuit

perhaps unnecessary to say that the narrator of this incident
gives it in implicit belief of the saintly character
of the splendid knight.</p>

<p>Not saints alone, but necromancers were occasionally
attached to military expeditions. Such an auxiliary,
according to Wace, accompanied Duke William in his
expedition to England:&mdash;</p>

<p>In examining the <span class="smcap">body-armour</span> of the period under
review, though we find some change in the adaptations
of the old fabrics,&mdash;of the quilted-work, of the interlinked
chain-mail, of the scale and jazerant,&mdash;there appears to
be only one piece which is entirely new,&mdash;the so-called
<i>Plastron de fer</i>, a breastplate that was worn beneath the
gambeson or other armour that formed a general covering
for the body. In a preceding passage from the
<i>Speculum Regale</i>, we have read of a breast-defence of
iron, extending from the throat to the waist, which may
have been the breastplate in question. But a passage
of Guillaume le Breton more exactly defines this contrivance.
In the encounter between Richard C&#339;ur-de-Lion
(then earl of Poitou), and Guillaume des Barres:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<p>A further evidence of this additional arming of the
breast may be derived from the present practice of the
East, where quilted coats-of-fence have a lining of iron
plates at that part only. In the museum of the United
Service Institution may be seen Chinese armours of this
construction.</p>

<p>Though from written testimonies we learn that the
fabrics already enumerated were in use, and that the
materials of the defences were iron, leather, horn, and
various kinds of quilting, it is by no means easy to
identify these structures in the pictorial monuments of
the day. Nothing perhaps can more strongly mark this
fact, than the diversity of interpretation that has been
given to the armours in the Bayeux tapestry by some
of the latest and most critical investigators of the subject.
Von Leber sees in them a contrivance of leather
and metal bosses: "ein Lederwamms mit aufgenÃ¤hten
Metallscheiben oder Metallbukeln<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>." M. Allou attires
the warrior in a "vÃªtement particulier formÃ© d'anneaux
ou de mailles de fer, ou bien de petites piÃ¨ces de
mÃªme mÃ©tal assemblÃ©es Ã  la maniÃ¨re des tuiles ou des
Ã©cailles de poisson<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>." In the <i>Bulletin Monumental</i> of the
SociÃ©tÃ© FranÃ§aise, vol. xi., page 519, we have: "On
croit distinguer, d'aprÃ¨s l'indication de la broderie, des
disques en mÃ©tal appliquÃ©s sur une jaque de cuir."
Mr. Kerrich<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> considers the coats marked with rounds as
chain-mail. M. de Caumont has remarked that "in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Bayeux tapestry some of the figures are in chain-mail,
and others in a kind of armour composed apparently of
metallic discs sewn to a leathern <i>jaque</i><a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>." In the following
we have collected the various modes of indicating the
armour in this tapestry, and it must be confessed that
to appropriate each is no easy task. It is indeed rather
from a comparison with numerous other monuments,
than from the testimony of these examples alone, that
one is able to form any opinion as to the fabrics intended;
and even at last the conclusion <i>must</i> be doubtful,
and may be erroneous. From analogous representations
of various dates, however, it seems likely that
the figures 1 and 2 are intended for interlinked chain-mail;
Nos. 3 and 4 for jazerant-work (armour formed of
small plates fastened by rivets to a garment of cloth or
canvas); Nos. 5 and 6 appear to be plain quilted defences;
No. 7 seems only a rude attempt to represent
the quilted coif; No. 8 is one of many examples where
different markings are used on the same garment. In
some instances, the markings copied above are so
strangely intermixed in the same dress, that one is led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
to doubt if, in any case, each differing pattern is intended
to represent a different kind of armour.</p>

<p>If from the tapestries we turn to the seals of this
period, we shall find a similar difficulty in appropriating
the armours represented. The modes of marking the
defences are four. One of these is a sort of honeycomb-work,
formed by a number of small, shallow, circular
apertures, leaving a raised line running round their
edges, so as to give a reticulated appearance to the
surface. See woodcuts <a href="#i_171.jpg">42</a> and <a href="#i_178.jpg">43</a>. This texture seems
to represent interlinked chain-mail. A second mode
consists of a series of lines crossing each other, so as
to form a trellis-work of lozenges.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

</div>

<p>The great seal of King Stephen here given affords an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
instance of this method. Compare also woodcut No. <a href="#i_167.jpg">41</a>.
This, if not another conventional mode of representing
interlinked chain-mail, may be intended for quilted
armour. A third kind of engraving presents a number
of raised half-circles covering the surface of the hauberk.
See woodcut No. <a href="#i_129.jpg">26</a>. This, though often described
as scale-armour, seems to be no more than the
ordinary chain-mail, the difficulty of representing which
threw the middle-age artists upon a variety of expedients
to obtain a satisfactory result. In the fourth
method, lines of half-circles placed contiguously cover
the whole exterior of the garment; and that this is
another mode of indicating chain-mail is clearly proved
by the similar work found on monuments of all kinds,
even to the sixteenth century. See woodcut No. <a href="#i_026.jpg">1</a>, fig. 1.</p>

<p>From this glimpse at the seals and tapestries, (and the
illuminated manuscripts of the period contribute similar
testimony,) we may gather that the artists of this day
had no uniform method of depicting the knightly harness;
so that, instead of endeavouring to find a different
kind of armour for every varying pattern of the limners,
we should rather regard the varied patterns of the limners
as so many rude attempts to represent a few armours.
In the following sketch we have collected some of the
methods in use at various times to indicate the ordinary
interlinked chain-mail.</p>

<p>Figure 1 is the most usual, and is found from the
twelfth century to the sixteenth. See woodcut No. <a href="#i_001.jpg">1</a>,
the seal of King Richard I. Late examples occur in the
brass of Sir William Molineux, 1548<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>; in the sculptured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
effigy of Sir Giles Daubeny in Westminster Abbey; and
in the statue of Sir Humfrey Bradburne, on his monument
in Ashborne Church, Derbyshire, 1581. Fig. 2 is
seen on our woodcuts <a href="#i_154.jpg">32</a>, <a href="#i_162.jpg">37</a>, and <a href="#i_257.jpg">53</a>, from manuscript
miniatures: it occurs in sculpture among the effigies of
the Temple Church, London. Fig. 3 is of frequent
appearance. See woodcut No. <a href="#i_274.jpg">59</a>. The most ancient
monumental brass extant, that of Sir John D'Aubernoun,
(woodcut <a href="#i_264.jpg">55</a>,) also exhibits this mode of indicating the
armour. Fig. 4 occurs in the brass of Sir Richard de
Buslingthorpe, c. 1280, figured by Waller, Part x.
Fig. 5 is from one of the effigies in the Temple Church:
the lines are undulating channels in the stone. Fig. 6
is from the sculptured effigy of Rudolf von Thierstein,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
at Basle: engraved in Hefner's Costumes, part ii.,
Plate <span class="smcap">xli</span>. Fig. 7 occurs on the monumental statue of
Sir Walter Arden, in Aston Church, Warwickshire<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>.
Fig. 8 is found in early woodcuts: as in the <i>Morte
d'Arthur</i>, printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1498.
Fig. 9: an early example of this marking occurs in
Willemin's <i>Monuments InÃ©dits</i>, vol. i., Plate 30; a late
one (sixteenth century) in the incised slab of a Bagot,
in the church of Blithfield, Staffordshire. Fig. 10: a
variety of the foregoing. See Hefner's <i>Trachten</i>, part i.,
Plate <span class="smcap">lxv</span>., and part ii., Plate <span class="smcap">xxxiv</span>. Fig. 11: from
an ivory chess-piece of the thirteenth century: woodcut
No. <a href="#i_296.jpg">69</a>. The lines are incised, the rounds are punctured.
Fig. 12 is a very frequent pattern. It appears in the
Bayeux tapestry, in manuscript miniatures, and in ivory
carvings. See the chess-piece engraved in <i>ArchÃ¦ologia</i>,
<span class="smcap">xxiv</span>. 238, from the Isle of Lewis; and compare the
figures of that very curious Asiatic roll in the Museum
of the Royal Asiatic Society. Fig. 13: this trellis-work
is common in seals of the twelfth century. See our
woodcuts No. <a href="#i_149.jpg">30</a> and <a href="#i_167.jpg">41</a>. The lozenges are slightly
sunk, the fillets in relief. Fig. 14: found in the Bayeux
tapestry; in the <i>Bible de St. Martial</i> of the Imperial
Library of Paris, twelfth century; and in Add. MS.,
15,277, of the fifteenth century, where the mailing is
expressed throughout in this manner. The Asiatic roll
named above has it also. Fig. 15: from the statuette
of "Sir de la Tremouille," 1514, in the collection at
Goodrich Court. The figure is of steel, and the squares
appear to have been formed by a punch. Fig. 16: from
the sculptured effigy of a Berkeley in Bristol Cathedral.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
The markings are channels in the stone. Fig. 17: from
Roy. MS., 14, E. iv. The mailing in this volume is
expressed by close, fine lines: the manuscript is of the
fifteenth century. Fig. 18: the honeycomb-work found
on early seals. The great seal of King Stephen (woodcut
<a href="#i_171.jpg">42</a>) affords a good example. The rounds are depressed,
the edges have a reticulated appearance. Figs. 19 and
20: from the illuminations of a Sanscrit MS. in the
British Museum, (Add. MSS., 15,295-7.) These very
curious volumes abound in armed figures, which are large,
and carefully finished. Fig. 21: from Egerton MS., No.
809, twelfth century; and Add. MS. 15,268, of the
thirteenth century. Fig. 22: from Harleian MS., 2803.
This differs but little from fig. 20; but fig. 20 has more
of the <i>scale</i> form, while this is rather of <i>ring</i>-work. Fig.
23 is a marking found in early etchings, and very well
represents the texture of chain-mail.</p>

<p>As we have already seen, the Body-armours which
may most safely be assigned to early Norman times are
chain-mail, quilted-work, jazerant, scale, and a small
proportion of plate used as an additional protection to
the breast: the materials, iron, leather, and horn, with
wool, tow, or cotton for quilting pourpointed defences.
The ordinary series of body-garments worn by the knight
are the Tunic, the Gambeson and the Hauberk. The
Surcoat, though found in some rare instances at the close
of the twelfth century, does not become a characteristic
part of the knightly equipment till the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>The Tunic appearing from beneath the hauberk may
be seen in the seals of Alexander I. of Scotland, and of
Richard I. of England, (cuts <a href="#i_026.jpg">1</a> and <a href="#i_134.jpg">27</a>,) and in the accompanying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
group from Harleian Roll, Y. 6, the "Life of
Saint Guthlac," a work of the close of the twelfth century.
Compare also woodcuts
<a href="#i_157.jpg">34</a>, <a href="#i_159.jpg">35</a>, and <a href="#i_165.jpg">40</a>. We
have already had written
notice of this garment in
the "blautann panzara"
of the <i>Speculum Regale</i>.
Wace gives it also to
Bishop Odo, for the field
of Hastings:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Gambeson (or
Wambasium<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>,) was a
quilted garment, used
either alone, or with other
armour. This defence is
as early as the Ancient
Egyptians, and figured
examples of it may be
seen in Sir Gardner Wilkinson's
work, Plate <span class="smcap">iii</span>.,
and cut <a href="#i_219.jpg">46</a>, (ed. 1837).
From a curious passage
of the <i>Chronicon Colmariense</i>
we learn that it was stuffed with wool, tow, or old
rags:&mdash;"<i>Armati</i> reputabantur qui galeas ferreas in capitibus
habebant, et qui <i>wambasia</i>, id est, tunicam spissam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
ex lino et stuppa, vel veteribus pannis consutam, et desuper
<i>camisiam ferream</i>, id est vestem ex circulis ferreis
contextam." An ancient authority quoted by Adelung
has also: "vestimenti genus, quod de coactili ad mensuram
et tutelam pectoris humani conficitur, de mollibus
lanis," &amp;c.</p>

<p>As the sole armour of the soldier, the gambeson is
mentioned both by Wace and Guillaume le Breton. The
former tells us, in his description of the troops of Duke
William preparing for the fight:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Plusors orent vestu gambais."&mdash;<i>Rom. de Rou</i>, l. 12811.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The latter says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Pectora tot coriis, tot gambesonibus armant."&mdash;<i>Philipp.</i>, lib. ii.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>These were probably foot-troops; but a document of
the next century shews us that horsemen were sometimes
armed in the wambais only. In 1285, land in
Rewenhall, Essex, is held by Eustace de Ho, "per serjantiam
inveniendi unum hominem equitem cum uno
gambesone in exercitu Dom. Regis, cum contigerit ipsum
ire in Wallia, sumptibus suis propriis per <span class="smcap">xl</span>. dies<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>." It
seems likely that many of these quilted coats-of-fence
were reinforced by plates of iron over the breast, as in
the pourpointed armours of the East in the present day.
As an additional reason for considering the defences of
gamboised work to be those indicated by the cross-lines
of the ancient vellum-pictures, we may mention that the
garments thus marked are occasionally tinted in various
colours. Thus, the figures in a Massacre of the Innocents,
in Cotton MS., Caligula, A. vii., are painted with red,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
blue, green, and buff; and another in Count Bastard's
work, from a French manuscript of the twelfth century,
has the garment marked with stripes of red<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>. The "Aketon"
appears to be but another name for the gambeson.</p>

<p>The Hauberk was the chief knightly defence. It
reached to the knees; the skirt sometimes opening in
front, sometimes at the sides. The sleeves usually terminated
at the elbow, but occasionally extended to the
wrist. Sometimes the hauberk reached as high as the
neck only, but more generally it was continued so as to
form a coif, leaving only the face of the knight exposed
to view. In many examples in the Bayeux tapestry, it
is furnished with a kind of
pectoral, the construction of
which has not been ascertained:
in other cases, the
whole surface is of a uniform
structure. In this rude
but curious little figure
from Harleian MS., 603<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>,
a work of the close of the
eleventh century, probably
executed in France, we
have a good example of the
hauberk of the period, with
its short sleeves, and the
skirts open in front for
convenience of riding. This
is exactly the hauberk of the
Bayeux tapestry, though
more clearly depicted here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
than in the needle-work of the tapestry. The rounds on
the surface appear to be a conventional mode of representing
chain-mail. The figure is that of Goliath, to
whom therefore has been given the long beard and
round target of the pagan Northmen. He wears, however,
the conical nasal helmet of the knightly order.</p>

<p>In this example, from Cottonian MS., Nero, C. iv.
fol. 13, written in France, about 1125, we have a curious
instance of the hauberk with lateral
openings at the skirt. It is remarkable
also for the manner in which the
sword is carried partially beneath the
hauberk; a contrivance seen also in
the Bayeux tapestry, (Plate <span class="smcap">vi</span>.,) and
of which analogous examples will be
found throughout the middle-ages. In
the figure before us, it will be observed
that the defence is continued
over the head as a coif or hood, and
is surmounted by the usual conical
nasal helmet, or "Casque Normand."
The subject of which this forms part,
is the Massacre of the Innocents. The
stigma of a moustache is therefore
added, in the same spirit as the beard
was given to Goliath in the preceding
example.</p>

<p>The continuous Coif to the hauberk
is seen constantly in the Bayeux
tapestry, (Stothard, Plates <span class="smcap">x</span>. to <span class="smcap">xiii</span>.).
It occurs also on many of the seals of the twelfth century,
(see our cuts, No. <a href="#i_134.jpg">27</a>, <a href="#i_178.jpg">43</a> and <a href="#i_197.jpg">44</a>;) and in vellum-paintings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
of this time, (see cuts <a href="#i_154.jpg">32</a>, <a href="#i_157.jpg">34</a>, <a href="#i_162.jpg">37</a> and <a href="#i_163.jpg">38</a>). The hood
of mail made separately from the hauberk does not appear
till the thirteenth century. The short sleeves of
this garment are seen in our woodcuts <a href="#i_119.jpg">25</a>, <a href="#i_154.jpg">32</a> and <a href="#i_163.jpg">38</a>.
Examples of the long-sleeved hauberk occur in cuts <a href="#i_146.jpg">28</a>,

<p>The Haubergeon, as the name indicates, was a smaller
hauberk; though it does not appear by the pictorial
monuments of the middle ages in what it especially
differed from the latter defence. While Duke William,

<p>All which seems to shew that Odo was equipped as a
light-armed fighter. And perhaps we may gather from
the prominent notice accorded to his "white tunic," that
it was the <i>shortness</i> of the haubergeon which caused that
garment to be so particularly remarked. In documents
of the thirteenth century, the haubergeon is distinguished
from the hauberk and gambeson, taking its place between
them. Thus the Statute of Arms of 1252 directs every
man, according to the rate of his lands and chattels, to
provide himself with the <i>lorica</i>, or with the <i>habergetum</i>,
or with the <i>perpunctum</i>. And the Statute of Winchester,
in 1285, makes the same distinction. From Guillaume
Guiart we learn that this garment was of mail:&mdash;</p>

<p>Body-armour of Leather is found throughout the middle

fastened to their breasts:&mdash;</p>

<p>A good example
of the Scale-armour
worn occasionally about
the close of the
eleventh century is
afforded in the following
group, given by
Hefner<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> from a vellum-painting
in his
possession. The armour
in the original
is silvered, and the
pendent scales of the
foremost figure are ornamented
with bosses
of gold. The tunics
are white, shaded with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
blue. The Princess Anna Comnena tells us that some
of the French knights at this period were clothed in
scale-armour<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>.</p>

<p>The material of the scale-armour is occasionally Horn.
In the twelfth century, the Emperor Henry V. clothed a
body of his troops in an impenetrable scale-armour of
horn: "So trug im Jahre 1115 eine Schaar im Heere
Heinrichs V. undurchdringliche Harnische von Horn<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>."
And in the poem of "Wigalois," written about the close
of the twelfth century, we have a curious description of
this horn-mail worn over the hauberk and richly adorned
with gold and precious stones:&mdash;</p>

<p>The accompanying little figure
from Harleian MS., No. 603,
fol. 13<sup>vo</sup>., appears to wear a
defence of scale-work, but of
what material it is difficult to
say. The original is a pen-drawing
only: the manuscript,
of the close of the eleventh
century. The figure is further
curious for the mantle fastened at the right shoulder
by a fibula.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>From the monuments of this time, it does not appear
that leg-defences were general. In the Bayeux tapestry
they are accorded only to the most distinguished personages:
in these cases, they are generally marked with
rounds, as the hauberks are, probably indicating chain-mail.
In this tapestry, three other modes of clothing the
leg are seen: in some figures the crossing lines forming
lozenges are found, which we have assumed to be pourpointerie;
in others appear the fasciÃ¦, or winding bands,
which we have already observed among the Anglo-Saxons:
and in many, the chausses are merely represented of a
single colour, as red, blue, or yellow; which does not
seem to imply armour of any kind. Wace makes mention
of iron chausses:&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>They are seen in the great seals of Richard the First,
(cut <a href="#i_026.jpg">1</a>,) and in other monuments of the twelfth century.
In this curious group of David and Goliath, from a German
manuscript in the British Museum, dated 1148<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>,
we have a singular example of studded chausses: the
chain-work of the hauberk being marked in rows of half-circles,
and coloured grey in the original, the chausses
marked in rounds, and silvered, it becomes clear that the
latter garment is of a different construction from the coat.
From its being elastic, as shewn at the foot, it probably
was a defence of pourpointerie, the bossed rivets being
for the purpose of keeping the quilting in its place.</p>

<p>Such defences are frequently seen in monuments of the
fourteenth century, and real armour of this fabric will be
found among the Eastern examples in the Tower collection
and the United Service Museum. Where the
chausses are not of a defensive construction, the warrior
has commonly short boots, similar to those seen on the
figure of David in the foregoing
woodcut. In the
following example they
are of a more ornamental
character than usual; and
the chausses in this figure
are also of a peculiar
fashion. The subject is
from Harl. MS. 2803,
written about 1170, and
represents Goliath. The
short boot occurs likewise
on the seals of William
the Conqueror and of
Alexander I. of Scotland,
(cuts <a href="#i_119.jpg">25</a> and <a href="#i_134.jpg">27</a>). See also
examples from illuminated
manuscripts in our engravings
<a href="#i_154.jpg">32</a>, <a href="#i_157.jpg">34</a> and <a href="#i_160.jpg">36</a>.
At the close of the eleventh
century, the fashion of the
boots ran into an excess
which much disturbed the
equanimity of churchmen
and chroniclers. "Then," says Malmesbury, under
the reign of William Rufus, "was there flowing hair and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
extravagant dress; and then was invented the fashion of
shoes with curved points." (Bk. iv. c. 1.) This device is
said to have originated with Fulk, earl of Anjou, who
sought thus to hide a deformity of his feet. Ordericus
Vitalis, who gives us the information, adds, that the
fashion soon spread, and the shoemakers made their
wares with points like a scorpion's tail: "unde sutores
in calceamentis quasi caudas scorpionum, quas vulgo
<i>Pigacias</i> appellant, faciunt." This not being enough, a
fellow of the court of Rufus,&mdash;"Robertus quidam <i>nebulo</i>
in curia Rufi Regis,"&mdash;filling the peak with tow, twisted
it round in the form of a ram's horn; a fancy much approved
by the courtiers, who distinguished the inventor
of the fashion with the surname of Cornardus. (Eccl.
Hist., lib. viii.)</p>

<p>Examples of the Mantle worn over the armour are
somewhat rare. The two following illustrations, from
monuments of the twelfth century, exhibit this arrangement.
The first is from a sculptured doorway of Ruardean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
Church, in Gloucestershire, and represents St. George.
The cloak is here fastened by a fibula in front. The
second subject is from an enamel preserved at the
Louvre. The patriarch Abraham, armed as a knight,
with hauberk and nasal helmet, has his mantle fastened
at the right shoulder. Another subject from this enamel
is engraved in the <i>Revue ArchÃ©ologique</i>, vol. vi., page 99:
Heraclius slaying Cosroes. "Eraclius Rex" is armed
exactly like the figure of Abraham before us, and though
engaged in the decollation of the infidel monarch, still
retains the flowing and capacious mantle. See also, for
the cloak of this period, our woodcut No. <a href="#i_160.jpg">36</a>, and
"Glossary of Architecture," vol. ii., Plate <span class="smcap">lxxiii</span>.</p>

<p>The characteristic Helmet of this time is the conical
nasal helmet, of which we have seen examples in the
close of the former period. The face-guard, or nasal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
was a revival from classic days. Good examples, of Greek
art, appear among the figures on the tympana of the
temple of Minerva at Ã†gina; careful casts of which have
been placed in the collection at Sydenham. The nasal
helmet is found, not alone in the eleventh and twelfth
centuries, but occasionally in every century down to the
seventeenth. In the Bayeux tapestry it is almost universal,
the nasal being much broader than that of Greek
times, the crown conical, and not much raised above the
head. In some cases tasselled cords appear at the back
of the head-piece (see Plate <span class="smcap">xi</span>. of the tapestry), which
may have served to fasten it to the coif below; but the
chief fastening of the casque was by means of laces
meeting under the chin. See the seal of William the
Conqueror (woodcut <a href="#i_119.jpg">25</a>), and the excellent example in
the Kerrich Collections, from a sculpture at Modena (Add.
MSS., 6728, fol. 17). The round and flat-topped helmets
of the twelfth century have also the nasal. Of the first
an instance occurs in the seal of Patrick Dunbar, earl
of March, engraved in Laing's "Scottish Seals." The
second appears in the figures of the Harleian Roll, Y. 6,
(woodcut <a href="#i_154.jpg">32</a>). In seals, it is often very difficult to tell
whether a nasal has existed or not, from the melting of
the wax, and from this defence following so closely the
line of the face. In some rare instances, a sort of peak is
used instead of the nasal, not descending below the eyebrows.
See Plate 65 of Hefner's "Costumes;" and compare
the figure on folio 9 of Cotton. MS., Tiber., C. vi.,
an example of Anglo-Saxon times. To the nasal helmet,
cheek-pieces and a neck-defence were occasionally added.
These pieces are also found on Greek examples, and appear,
too, in modern Eastern armour; as may be seen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
the helmet of Tippoo Saib, preserved in the India House
Museum. The casque with neck-piece appears in the
Bayeux tapestry (see Plate <span class="smcap">ix</span>.), and on the seal of
Stephen de Curzun, (Cotton Charter, V. 49). The nasal
helmet with neck-guard and cheek-defences occurs among
the chess-pieces found in the Isle of Lewis, and now in
the British Museum.</p>

   <p class="caption3">No. 41.</p>
</div>

<p>The helmets not having nasals are chiefly conical, round
and flat-topped. The old combed form of Anglo-Saxon
times occurs in Harl. MS. 603, fol. 13<sup>vo</sup>., a book of the
close of the eleventh century. The Phrygian form appears
in Harl. MS. 2800, fol. 21 of vol. ii., a work of the
close of the twelfth century. The conical casque is found
in the annexed seal of Conan, duke of Britanny, circa
1165: from Harl. Chart., 48, G. 40. The round-topped
helmet is seen on the first seal of Richard I., (woodcut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
<a href="#i_026.jpg">1</a>, fig. 1,) and in many examples in Cotton MS.,
Titus, D. xvi. The cylindrical or flat-topped helmet appears
to have come into fashion towards the close of the
twelfth century. In its earliest form it resembled that
on the second seal of Richard I., (woodcut <a href="#i_026.jpg">1</a>, fig. 2,) and
the similar examples figured in Stothard's Monuments,
Plate <span class="smcap">xxiv</span>., and Surtees' Durham, vol. i. p. 24, and vol.
ii. p. 139. In all these examples the casque is of one
piece, having two horizontal clefts for vision, and being
strengthened by bands crossing each other over the face
and on the top. The Durham examples are without
ornament, but the helmet of Richard has a fan-crest,
ensigned in its lower portion with a lion. The seal of
Baldwin, earl of Flanders, circa 1191, badly engraved by
Vredius, offers another early example of the flat-topped
knightly helm. The cylindrical casque common in the
next century differs from this in having a <i>grated ventail</i>;
by which a better supply of air could always be obtained
by the warrior, and a still more abundant provision occasionally
acquired by opening the ventaglia, which to
this end was constructed with hinges at the side. Some
varieties of the casque worn during the twelfth century
may be seen in the <i>ArchÃ¦ologia</i>, vol. xxiv., copied by Sir
Frederic Madden from the Isle of Lewis chess-pieces in
the British Museum. Among these will be remarked
the "Iron Hat," with its round crown and flat rim, of
which we have already traced the descent from the <i>petasus</i>
of classic times<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>. Sometimes the helmets are surmounted
with a kind of knop or button; as in the picture given
by Silvestre from a Latin Horace in the Paris Library<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
in the seal of William the Conqueror, in the Bayeux
tapestry, and in the Spanish manuscript of the year
1109 in the British Museum, (Add. MS. 11,695, fol.
194).</p>

<p>The fan-crest represented in the seal of Richard I. is
a very early instance of a fashion which came into more
favour towards the close of the thirteenth century. Fan-crests,
as we have seen, were in use among the Ancient
Egyptians, Assyrians, Greeks, Romans, and again among
the Anglo-Saxons. But they do not appear during the
rule of the Norman kings in England till the end of
the thirteenth century; except in this single instance
of Richard's seal. It may perhaps be doubted if the monarch
ever wore such a decoration: an embellishment, perhaps,
added by the seal-engraver from some monument of
classic times. This seems the more likely from the fact
that, in classic examples, the union of a fan-crest with
a casque adorned on its sides with an animal form,
is of constant occurrence. Among a thousand examples
that might be cited, we may quote, as a readily accessible
authority, Montfaucon's <i>AntiquitÃ© ExpliquÃ©e</i>, vol. i.,
Plate <span class="smcap">xlii</span>. At a later period of the middle-ages, this
combination is again found: the helmet on the seal of
Reinald, Graf von Geldern in 1343, has a striking resemblance
to that of Richard: a lion is figured on the part
surmounting the crown of the head, and over that again
is placed the fan-crest. A copy of this monument may
be seen in the useful series of "Ancient Seals" in the
collection at Sydenham. Early examples of the casque
ornamented with a heraldic device on its <i>surface</i> are
offered by the enamelled tablet at Le Mans, attributed
to Geoffry of Anjou, (Stothard, Plate <span class="smcap">ii</span>.,) and the effigy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
of "Johan le Botiler," circa 1300, engraved in our woodcut
No. <a href="#i_314.jpg">74</a>.</p>

<p>The Shields of this period are chiefly the kite-shaped,
the triangular, and the round. The first two are sometimes
flat, and sometimes bowed; the round are flat or
convex. The kite-shield is of most frequent occurrence
during the earlier part of the period under examination,
the triangular during the latter. As the round target
was most convenient for the foot-fighter, so the kite-shield,
broad in its upper part, so as to cover the body of
the warrior, and narrow where the leg only required to be
defended, and where the position of the knight on his
horse necessitated a tapering form, seems to have been
most in favour with the horseman. The bowed kite-shield
is very distinctly shewn in many cotemporary
monuments: in Cotton MS., Titus, D. xvi., of the close
of the eleventh century; in the curious pyx from the
collection of the late T. Crofton Croker, Esq., engraved
in the "Gentleman's Magazine" for 1833; in Harl. MS.,
2895, fol. 82; in the enamelled figure attributed to Geoffry
of Anjou; and in the seals of King Stephen, (woodcuts
<a href="#i_149.jpg">30</a> and <a href="#i_171.jpg">42</a>). The Princess Anna Comnena, at the close
of the eleventh century, tells us that the shields of the
French crusading knights were of this fashion:&mdash;"For
defence they bear an impenetrable shield, not of a round,
but of an oblong shape; broad at the upper part and terminating
in a point. The surface is not flat, but convex,
so as to embrace the person of the wearer; an umbo
of shining brass is in the middle; and the exterior face
is of metal so highly polished by frequent rubbing as to
dazzle the eyes of the beholder<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>
<p>The flat kite-shield is not always to be identified in
the drawings of the time, because the shadeless outlines
of the limners may pass for either flat or bowed surfaces.
But that some at least of those in the Bayeux tapestry
were flat, seems clear from the soldiers using them as
trays on which to set the cups and dishes of their
"Prandium." (See Plate <span class="smcap">xi</span>.) Ivory carvings also shew
the flat kite-shield: the Isle of Lewis chessmen afford
good examples.</p>

<p>As we have seen from the above passage of Anna
Comnena, the old Northern fashion of the boss or umbo
was still occasionally retained; but such an adjunct to a
horseman's target seems rather for ornament than use.
The bossed kite-shield occurs in the enamel of Geoffrey
Plantagenet; in the pyx named above; and in Harl. MS.
2895, fol. 82.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>In lieu of the convex boss, the shield has sometimes a
projecting spike; as in the great seal of King Stephen,
here given; and in the first seal of Richard I. It occurs
also in the seals of William de Romara (temp. Hen. I.),
in the office of the Duchy of Lancaster, and of a
Curzun (Cotton Charter, V. 49).</p>

<p>About the middle of the twelfth century appears the
triangular shield,&mdash;a form obtained by reducing the arched
top of the kite to a straight, or nearly straight, line.
This variety also was either bowed or flat; and though
the earliest examples are as tall as the kite-shields of the
eleventh century, the triangular target soon became much
reduced in its height. The form of this defence, both
the flat and the bowed kind, may be seen in the seals of
Henry II. and Richard I. (cuts <a href="#i_026.jpg">1</a> and <a href="#i_197.jpg">44</a>), the figures
from Hefner's <i>Trachten</i>, (cut <a href="#i_159.jpg">35</a>), and those from Harleian
Roll, Y. 6 (cut <a href="#i_154.jpg">32</a>).</p>

<p>The round shield is of more rare appearance. It occurs
in Harl. MS. 603, of the close of the eleventh century;
in the Spanish MS. of 1109, already cited; and in the
Psalter of Eadwine, circa 1150. Though the circular
target does not often appear in miniature paintings, it is
probable that it was in frequent use among the foot
troops.</p>

<p>The kite and triangular shields were provided with
straps for attachment to the arm and for suspension
round the neck. The first were called <i>enarmes</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>There was some variety in their arrangement, but the
object was always to attach the shield to the fore-arm:
the round target of the Anglo-Saxons, on the contrary,
was held at arm's-length by a bar grasped by the hand.
Examples of the <i>enarmes</i> of this period may be found in
Plate <span class="smcap">v</span>. of the Bayeux tapestry. See also the seal of
Henry II., (woodcut <a href="#i_178.jpg">43</a>). The <i>guige</i> or strap for suspension
has already been described, as to its purpose, in our
first division. It is represented in our woodcuts <a href="#i_154.jpg">32</a>, <a href="#i_159.jpg">35</a>,
<a href="#i_171.jpg">42</a> and <a href="#i_178.jpg">43</a>. By aid of the <i>guige</i>, the shield, when not in
use, could be carried at the back. An example, of the
close of the twelfth century, is offered by a vellum-painting
of Harl. MS. 2800, vol. ii. fol. 21. It is also seen in
the very curious carved church-door from Iceland, figured
at page 103 of Mr. Worsaae's "Copenhagen Museum."</p>

<p>The Devices upon the Shields in the earlier part of the
period under examination are devotional or fanciful. In
the second half of the twelfth century, heraldic bearings
that became hereditary, began to appear. The earlier
shield-paintings consist of crosses, rounds or bezants,
dragons, interlacing bands, flat tints bordered with a
different hue, or simple flat tints; with some varieties
which the pencil only can explain with clearness.
Numerous examples of these in all their diversity will
be found in the Bayeux tapestry, in Sir Frederic
Madden's paper on the Isle of Lewis chessmen, (<i>ArchÃ¦ol.</i>,
vol. xxiv.) and among the plates of Shaw's "Dresses
and Decorations."</p>

<p>The two seals of Richard the First very exactly mark
the growth of the science of heraldry. In the earliest,
the monarch's shield is ensigned with the symbol of
valour, a lion. (See woodcut, No. <a href="#i_001.jpg">1</a>). But it is a rampant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
lion, and as the bowed shield presents only one half of
its surface to view, it has been conjectured that the complete
device would consist of two lions combatant. This
device, whether of one or two lions, has passed away,
among the serpents and knot-work of the earlier time;
but the bearing on Richard's second seal, three lions
passant gardant, retains its place in the royal escutcheon
to the present day. In this second seal of Richard (see
woodcut, No. <a href="#i_001.jpg">1</a>, fig. 2), the lion passant appears also on
the helmet of the monarch. Another example of the
repetition of a royal device is afforded by the seal of
Alexander II. of Scotland (circa 1214), where the lion
rampant figured on the shield is repeated on the saddle.
(Cotton Charters, xix. 2.)</p>

<p>The shields were often highly decorated with painting,
and even, if we may interpret literally the evidences of
chroniclers, with inlaid jewels. Examples of richly ornamented
shields of the twelfth century may be seen in
Shaw's "Dresses and Decorations," and in Harl. MS.
2895, fol. 82. Robert of Aix, in the eleventh century,
writing of the first crusade, tells us that the European
knights carried shields "auro et gemmis inserti variisque
coloribus depicti."</p>

<p>On board ship, the knights arranged their shields along
the side of the vessel, so as to form a kind of bulwark.
This is very clearly shewn in Plates <span class="smcap">ii</span>. and <span class="smcap">x</span>. of the
Bayeux tapestry.</p>

<p>And when at length the knight fell in battle, his kite-shield
served him for a bier. The nephew of the emperor
Otho having been slain before Rouen, the Germans&mdash;</p>

<p>As we have learned from a preceding passage, the
"shaven and shorn" knights of the Conqueror's time had,
in the reign of his successor, fallen into disrepute as
models of fashion. Long hair came into vogue, called
down the anathemas of the Church, suffered a temporary
discredit, and again rose into favour. Malmesbury has
a curious sketch of this fluctuation of fashion. In the
twenty-ninth regnal year of Henry I., he tells us, "a
circumstance occurred in England which may seem surprising
to our long-haired gallants, who, forgetting what
they were born, transform themselves into the fashion of
females, by the length of their locks. A certain English
knight, who prided himself on the luxuriancy of his
tresses, being stung by conscience on the subject, seemed
to feel in a dream as though some person strangled him
with his ringlets. Awaking in a fright, he immediately
cut off all his superfluous hair. The example spread
throughout England; and, as recent punishment is apt
to affect the mind, almost all military men allowed their
hair to be cropped in a proper manner without reluctance.
But this decency was not of long continuance; for scarcely
had a year expired, before all who thought themselves
courtly relapsed into their former vice, vying with women
in the length of their locks, and whenever they were defective,
supplying their place with false tresses<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>." In
1102, at a council held in London by Archbishop Anselm,
it was enacted that those who had long hair should be
cropped, so as to shew part of the ear and the eyes.
Compare also the well-known passage of Ordericus Vitalis,
where he tells us how Bishop Serlo, preaching before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
Henry I. and his court, inveighed so successfully against
the iniquity of long locks, that his audience saw the folly
of their ways; and the prelate, seizing the favourable
moment, produced a pair of scissors from his sleeve (<i>de
manticÃ¢ forcipes</i>), and cropped the king and many of his
courtiers with his own hand<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>.</p>

<p>From Wace and the Bayeux tapestry we have found
that the Beard was not worn by the Normans at the time
of the Conquest, though in fashion among the Anglo-Saxons:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Li Normant    *    *    *<br /></span>
<span class="i1">N'unt mie barbe ne guernons,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Co dist Heraut, com nos avons."&mdash;<i>Line</i> 12,252.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And the Normans continued their custom till the second
half of the twelfth century. The monumental effigy of
Henry II. at Fontevraud represents him without either
beard or moustache. "The beard," says Stothard<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>, "is
painted, and pencilled like a miniature, to represent its
being close shaven." Among the English, however, the
beard was often retained, and became a sort of protest
against the new dynasty<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>. In 1196 William Longbeard,
"le dernier des Saxons," as he is named by M. Thierry,
became conspicuous from his opposition to the Norman
rule, the inveteracy of which was manifested to the world
by the excessive length of his beard<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>. At this time,
however, a beard and moustache of moderate dimensions
were in vogue among both races. The effigy of Richard I.
at Fontevraud and that of King John at Worcester offer
good examples of this change of fashion.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">weapons</span> in use among the knightly order were
the lance, the sword, the mace, and, towards the middle
of the twelfth century, the axe. The shaft of the Lance
was of uniform thickness throughout, the swell at the
grip being a much later invention. The material was
usually ash or pine. Wace, in the <i>Roman de Rou</i>, has:&mdash;</p>

<p>Guillaume le Breton, describing the combat of Richard I.
and Guillaume des Barres, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Utraque per clypeos ad corpora <i>fraxinus</i> ibat."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And Albertus Aquensis, speaking of the French, tells
us: "HastÃ¦ fraxineÃ¦ in manibus eorum ferro acutissimo
prÃ¦fixÃ¦ sunt, quasi grandes perticÃ¦." The heads of the
lance were commonly of the leaf-form or the lozenge;
more rarely barbed. All three appear in the Bayeux
tapestry, and are found in many monuments throughout
the twelfth century. Lance-flags (or streamers) of two,
three, four, and of five points are found at the close of
the eleventh and during the twelfth centuries. See Harleian
MS. 603, the Bayeux tapestry, and our woodcuts,
Nos. <a href="#i_026.jpg">1</a>, <a href="#i_134.jpg">27</a>, <a href="#i_146.jpg">28</a>, <a href="#i_149.jpg">30</a> and <a href="#i_162.jpg">37</a>. A curious Eastern example
of the use of the lance-flag is found in the wall-painting
of the Ajunta caves, a work referred to the first century
of our era. A fine copy of this interesting monument
has been placed in the Museum of the East India
House. The spear was also a weapon of the inferior
troops:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>The Sword was of the old form: straight, broad,
two-edged, and pointed. The cross-piece was generally
straight: in other cases, curved towards the blade. Examples
of the latter fashion occur in the great seal of
King Henry II., here given; in Harl. MS. 603, <i>passim</i>;
and in Cotton MS., Titus, D. xvi. See also our woodcut,
No. <a href="#i_167.jpg">41</a>. The pommel was round, hemispherical, square,
lozenge, trefoiled or cinquefoiled. All these forms may be
seen in Harl. MS., 603, Titus, D. xvi., the Bayeux tapestry,
Addit. MS. 11,695, and the effigy of Henry II., figured
by Stothard. This effigy also shews very clearly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
Belt with its buckle, by which the sword was fastened
round the waist. Compare also the second plate of the
Bayeux tapestry, where the form of this short belt is very
distinctly exhibited. We have already noticed that the
sword was sometimes worn with its handle projecting
through a cleft in the hauberk, the scabbard being fixed
beneath the hauberk. See cut <a href="#i_157.jpg">34</a>, and Bayeux tapestry,
Plate <span class="smcap">vi</span>. As in our own day, swords attributed to ancient
heroes had an especial value, and became the most
cherished gifts of kings and nobles. Thus, when Richard
C&#339;ur-de-Lion was on his way to the Holy Land, "the
king of Sicily sent to him many presents of great value,
consisting of gold and silver, of horses and cloth of silk.
But the king of England would receive nothing from
him, except a little ring, which he accepted as a token of
their mutual esteem. On the other hand, King Richard
gave to King Tancred that most excellent sword which
the Britons call <i>Caliburn</i>, and which had been the sword
of Arthur, once the valiant king of England<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>."</p>

<p>The Sword of William the Conqueror became the
feudal instrument by which the Umfrevilles held the
lordship of Riddesdale, in Northumberland:&mdash;"In the
tenth year of William the Conqueror, Robert de Umfranvil,
knight, obtained from that king a grant of the
Lordship, Valley and Forest of Riddesdale, by the service
of defending that part of the country for ever from Enemies
and Wolves, with that Sword which King William
had by his side when he entered Northumberland<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>."</p>

<p>From a very curious drawing in the Psalter of Eadwine,
written at Canterbury in the middle of the twelfth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
century, and now preserved in the library of Trinity
College, Cambridge, we learn the exact manner in which
the soldiery of this day furbished and ground their
swords. The implement for furbishing is in the form
of an ordinary axe-head, fixed in the centre of a rod or
staff, which is held by both hands. This curious subject
has been engraved by Mr. Westwood in his <i>PalÃ¦ographia
Sacra</i>.</p>

<p>The Mace does not often appear in the pictorial monuments
of the period. It is, however, seen in the Bayeux
tapestry, in the hands of both armies. The heads are
quatrefoil, or of a heart-shape. What Wace calls the
"gibet" is considered to be the mace, and it is carried at
the right-hand side of the knight, to be used when the
lance had been broken:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Endementrez ke il versa,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sa lance chaÃ¯ Ã¨ froissa,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Et il a le <i>gibet</i> seisi,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ki a sun <i>destre bras pendi</i>."&mdash;<i>Rom. de Rou</i>, 1. 13,456.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was also the usual arm of Churchmen when they
went to battle; who sought thus to avoid the denunciation
against those "who smite with the sword." Under
the name of <i>clava</i>, it is mentioned by Guillaume le
Breton:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nunc contus, nunc clava caput, nunc vero bipennis<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Excerebrat."&mdash;<i>Philippidos</i>, p. 213.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Axe, which in the Bayeux tapestry is never seen
in the hands of the Norman knights, appears in the
twelfth century to have come into favour among them,
for even the kings of this race are said to have contended
with it. Thus Hoveden, describing the valour of Stephen
at the battle of Lincoln, in 1141, says:&mdash;"Then was seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the might of the king, equal to a thunderbolt, slaying
some with his immense battle-axe, and striking down
others. Then arose the shouts afresh, all rushing against
him, and he against all. At length, through the number
of the blows, the king's battle-axe was broken asunder.
Instantly, with his right hand, drawing his sword, he
marvellously waged the combat until the sword also was
broken. On seeing this, William de Kahamnes, a most
powerful knight, rushed upon the king, and seizing him
by the helmet, cried with loud voice, 'Hither, all of you,
come hither! I have taken the King.'"</p>

<p>In the quotation from the <i>Philippidos</i>, above, we have
seen that the double-axe, the <i>bipennis</i>, was also in use at
this time. Like the mace, it is of rare occurrence in the
pictures of the day, but several representations of it
will be found in Harleian MS. 603, a Latin Psalter of
the close of the eleventh century, probably written in
France.</p>

<p>Among the weapons in use by the common soldiery
are the cultellus, the guisarme, the pike, the bisacuta,
the javelin, the sling, the long-bow, the cross-bow, (at
the close of the twelfth century,) and some others in
which fire was the offensive agent. The Cultellus, or
coustel, was a short sword or long dagger, well calculated
for use of the foot-troops, rushing upon the knights
who had been unhorsed in the charge of the cavalry; and
equally well adapted for close fight of foot against foot.
A statute of William, king of Scotland, (1165-1214,)
shews the identity of the coustel and dagger: "Habeat
equum, habergeon, capitium e ferro, et cultellum qui dicitur
<i>dagger</i><a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>." In the fourteenth century, Knighton has:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
"Cultellos, quos <i>daggerios</i> vulgariter dicunt, in <i>powchiis</i>
impositis<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>." And Walsingham, in the fifteenth century,
writes: "Mox extracto cultello, quem <i>dagger</i> vulgo dicimus,
ictum militi minabatur<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>." The cultellus, like the sica
of classic times, not only became the weapon of the depredator,
but gave its name to that class; as we see from
a statute of the Count of Toulouse in 1152: "Si quis aliquem
hominem malum, quem Cultellarium dicimus, cum
cultellis euntem nocte causa furandi occiderit, nullum
damnum patiatur propter hoc." The Guisarme, which
we have already noticed in the previous chapter, was
still in favour in the twelfth century, and is frequently
mentioned by the writers of this period. A striking
passage of the <i>Philippidos</i> brings before us a rich group
of the weapons of this day:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nunc contus, nunc clava caput, nunc vero bipennis<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Excerebrat: sed nec bisacuta, sudisve vel hasta<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Otia vel gladius ducit."&mdash;<i>Page</i> 213.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The contus and the sudis of these lines are pikes, of
which the particular difference from each other would be
a vain enquiry for our times. The clava (mace) and bipennis
have been already noticed. The Bisacuta appears
to have been an arm of the pick kind. PÃ¨re Daniel cites
from a French poet who lived in 1376, these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Trop bien faisoit la besaguÃ«<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Qui est par les deux becs aguÃ«."&mdash;<i>Mil. FranÃ§.</i>, i. 433.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The phrase, <i>deux becs</i>, seems to indicate a form of the
kind we have mentioned, and the exact structure of the
weapon is perhaps presented to us in the well-known
brass of Bishop Wyvil, at Salisbury<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>. A letter remissory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
of the fourteenth century appears to confirm this view:
"Le dit Hue d'un gran <i>martel</i> qu'il portoit, appellÃ© besague,
getta au dit Colart," &amp;c. The head of the martel-d'armes
was constantly, on one or both sides, of this
pick or beak form. The besague was also a carpenter's
tool. Thus Wace, on the invasion of England by the
Normans, tells us:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>The Sling of this time may be seen, though rudely
drawn, in the group from Add. MS. 14,789, copied in
our woodcut No. <a href="#i_162.jpg">37</a>. Compare also cuts <a href="#i_086.jpg">12</a> and <a href="#i_232.jpg">50</a>.
The Javelin is found at the close of the eleventh century;
in the hands of the English in the Bayeux tapestry, and
in the French manuscript, Harl. 603, fol. 60. In the
twelfth century it seems to have fallen into discredit
among these nations, though probably employed to a
much later period by the Spaniards<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>, with whom it was
always a favourite weapon, and by those races who had
retained the rough fashions and the heroic traditions of
their Old-Northern ancestry.</p>

<p>The Long-bow was of the most simple construction: it
appears frequently in the Bayeux tapestry, (Plates <span class="smcap">xiii</span>.,
<span class="smcap">xv</span>. and <span class="smcap">xvi</span>.;) in the cotemporary manuscript, Harleian
603, and in many monuments of the twelfth century.
The arrows are usually barbed. A curious variety of the
arrow is seen in the Spanish codex, Addit. MSS. 11,695,
written in 1109. This missile, which is frequently represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
in the volume, has three pairs of barbs, fixed
at a little distance from each other along the shaft; a
cruel contrivance, which does not seem to have reached
other nations of Europe, and, we may hope, was not long
in vogue within the Pyrennees. Already in the twelfth
century the English began to evince that skill in archery
which afterwards gave them such celebrity. At the
siege of Messina by C&#339;ur-de-Lion, as we learn from
Richard of Devizes, the Sicilians were forced to leave
their walls unmanned, "because no one could look out
of doors, but he would have an arrow in his eye before
he could shut it." The king himself did not disdain
occasionally to use the bow. When before the castle
of Nottingham, which had been seized by "Earl John,"
the monarch, says Roger of Hoveden, "took up his
quarters near the castle, so that the archers therein
pierced the king's men at his very feet. The king, incensed
at this, put on his armour, and commanded his
troops to make an assault upon the castle; on which a
sharp conflict took place, and many fell on both sides.
The king himself slew one knight with an arrow, and
having at last prevailed, drove back his enemies into the
castle, took some outworks which had been thrown up
without the gates, and destroyed the outer gates by
fire<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>."</p>

<p>The practice of archery was encouraged and protected by
statute. Among the enactments of Henry I. of England,
it was provided, that if any one in practising with arrows
or with darts should by accident slay another, it was not

<p>The Quivers, as represented in the Bayeux tapestry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
are without covers; but on folio 25 of Harl. MS. 603, is
a drawing of a quiver having a cap attached by cords, so
that when the quiver is in use, the cap remains suspended
by the strings. The dress of the archers has been already
noticed.</p>

<p>The Cross-bow does not appear to have been recognised
as a military weapon before the close of the twelfth century.
The term <i>balista</i>, by which it is described in
monkish annals and other writings, is indeed found at
an earlier period; but there is great doubt whether
this earlier balista meant a hand-weapon, or one of those
"gyns" derived from classic times. The later use of the
arm seems confirmed by the fact that it is not found
in pictorial representations till about 1200. There appears
to have been an attempt to introduce it at the
beginning of this century, but it was prohibited by
papal decree as unfit for Christian warfare. A council
in 1139, under Innocent II., has: "Artem illam mortiferam
et Deo odibilem balistariorum et sagittariorum
adversus Christianos et Catholicos exerceri de cetero
sub anathemate prohibemus<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>." This denunciation
was renewed under Innocent III.; but by this time
Richard C&#339;ur-de-Lion and Philippe Auguste had sanctioned
the use of the arm, and the cross-bow was triumphant.
Both Guillaume le Breton and Guiart place the
introduction of the weapon at the close of the twelfth
century; and both tell us that Richard was the first to
adopt it, and that Philip followed his example. Describing
the siege of the castle of Boves, Brito says<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p>The form of the arbalest of this time may be seen in
our woodcut, No. <a href="#i_232.jpg">50</a>. It was bent by placing the foot
in the loop or "stirrup" at the extremity, and then
drawing the cord upwards with the hands. At a later
period, the bow was made much stronger, and of steel,
then requiring mechanical contrivances to bend it. The
arrow of the cross-bow was shorter and stouter than that
of the long-bow. As may be seen in our woodcut, No.
<a href="#i_232.jpg">50</a>, it was feathered; a particular which is noticed in
the <i>Roman de Garin</i>:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">"Volent piles plusque pluie par prÃ©s,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Et les saiettes et <i>carriax</i> empennÃ©s."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This name of Carriaux (quadrelli or quarrels) was given
to these missiles from the four-sided (or pyramidal) form
of the head. Thus Guillaume le Breton, speaking of the
death of Richard the First:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"&mdash;&mdash;QuadratÃ¦ cuspidis una<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>From an ordinance of Theobald, count of Champagne, in
the next century (1256), we learn that the provision of
quarrels for a cross-bow was fifty: "Chascun de la
commune dou Neufchastel qui aura vaillant xx. livres,
aura arbaleste en son hostel et quarraus jusqu'Ã  cinquante."
The arrow of the arbalest is sometimes called
<i>vireton</i>, from the French <i>virer</i>, on account of its rotary
flight. Compare the classical <i>verutum</i>, a javelin which
owed its name to a similar property. Though the English
appear to have used the cross-bow from near the
close of the twelfth to the end of the thirteenth century,
in the succeeding age the long-bow obtained a signal
triumph over its rival.</p>

<p>In the hands of a stout soldiery, indeed, the long-bow
is a much superior weapon; for a dozen arrows may be
discharged while the arbalester is winding up his instrument
and fixing a single quarrel: and the long-bow
being a vertical arm, permits a close array, which
cannot be attained with the horizontal cross-bow: again,
the long-bow is a weapon of very light carriage, while
its rival, with its thick bow of steel and its apparatus
for bending, is both ponderous and unwieldy: the size
of the quarrels also permitted only eighteen of them
to be brought by each man into the field, ("et auront
trousses empanÃ©es et cirÃ©es de dix-huit traits du moins:"
Ordinance of Charles VII. of France), while the English
archer carried "twenty-four Scotchmen under his belt."
"Les arbalestriers Gennevois," says Froissart, "commencÃ¨rent
Ã  traire, et ces archers d'Angleterre firent
voler ces sagettes de grand' faÃ§on, qui entrÃ¨rent et
descendirent si ouniement sur ces Gennevois que ce
sembloit neige. Les Gennevois, qui n'avoient pas appris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
Ã  trouver tels archers que sont ceux d'Angleterre, quand
ils sentirent ces sagettes qui leur perÃ§oient bras, tÃªtes
et banlÃ¨vre, furent tantÃ´t desconfits<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>." But to handle
the long-bow thus effectively, required a race strong in
sinew and practised in their art: to wind up and discharge
a cross-bow was the feat of a boy.</p>

<p>The Greek fire, still discountenanced among the Christian
states of the West, was in frequent use with the
enemies of the Cross in the East. All the accounts of
the Crusades contain instances of its employment. Of
the tubes from which it was discharged we have already
spoken. In the <i>BibliothÃ¨que des Croisades</i> of M. Reinaud<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>,
we have the account of a variety of this incendiary agent,
from the pen of an Arabian historian of the Third Crusade,
Ibn Alatir. "When Acre was besieged by the
Christians," he tells us, "there came into the town a
man of Damascus, to assist in its defence. He began by
casting upon the towers erected by the besiegers, pots
filled with naptha and other ingredients. These not
being alight, fell harmlessly among the Christians, who
laughed at and jeered the Mussulmans for their seeming
failure. Meanwhile, the man of Damascus waited till
the mixture had diffused itself over every part of the
tower. Then, casting forth a lighted missile, in an
instant the tower was in flames, and so rapid and so
extensive was the combustion, that the Christians had
no time to descend: men, arms, all was consumed."</p>

<p>From a curious passage of Wace we learn what were
the weapons employed by the peasantry when driven to
revolt against their lords. In describing the insurrection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
of the "vilains" under Richard the Second, duke of
Normandy, he makes these "bachelers de bele juvente"
exclaim:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A machues Ã¨ Ã  grant peus,<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>The <i>peus</i>, or <i>pieux</i>, were pikes; the <i>tineus</i> were poles
used to carry the grape-tubs at the vintage, which, when
converted into instruments of war, we may suppose were
armed with heads of iron. The idea of contention by
throwing stones is by no means a mere poetical fancy of
our author. Froissart even tells us of a victory achieved
by this means. A band of French knights and nobles
going to attack a section of the Free Companies, these
latter posted themselves on a hill, and being well provided
with stones, "cast them so forcibly upon those
who approached, that they broke their bassinets, however
strong they might be, and wounded and maimed the
men-at-arms to such an extent, that none either could or
dared to advance further, however good his shield might
be, (tant bien targÃ© qu'il fut). And this first division
was so thoroughly crushed that never again could it do
good service." Reinforcements arriving to the Companies,
a more regular onset was made: "Que vous
ferois-je long parlement? De celle besogne dont vous
oyez parler, les FranÃ§ois en eurent pour lors le pieur<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>."</p>

<p>In the manufacture of arms, the steel of Poitou had
already become celebrated. John, monk of Marmoustier,
who lived in the middle of the twelfth century, in describing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the knighting of Geoffry, duke of Normandy,
tells us that he had a lance of ash, armed with a
head of Poitou steel. Malmesbury distinguishes also
Lorraine. "At the siege of Antioch," he says, "Godfrey
of Bouillon, with a Lorrainian sword, cut asunder a Turk
who had demanded single combat, so that one half of the
man lay panting on the ground, while the other half was
carried off by the horse at full speed; so firmly did the
unbeliever keep his seat. Another also, who attacked
him, he clave asunder from the neck to the groin; nor
did the dreadful stroke stop here, but cut entirely
through the saddle and the backbone of the horse."
Hungary had at a very early period enjoyed a celebrity
for its weapon manufacture. Charlemagne, writing to
Offa of Mercia, offering him presents for his churches,
adds: "And for your own acceptance I send a belt, a
Hungarian sword, and two silk mantles<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>." The method
of hardening steel, in the eleventh and twelfth centuries,
by immersion, when red hot, in cold water, may be seen
in Theophilus Presbyter, lib. iii. cap. 19.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Flags and Standards</span> in use during this period
were the prince's standards, the banner, the pennon, and
the small lance-flag or streamer. The consecrated standard
of William I., bestowed by the Pope, appears to be represented
on the ninth plate of the Bayeux tapestry, where
it is figured of a square form and ensigned with a cross.
It was carried near the person of William throughout
the day by the knight Toustain: "Turstinus, filius Rollonis
<i>vexillum Normannorum</i> portavit<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>."</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Et quant li Dus tournout, tournout;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">E quant arestout, arestout."&mdash;<i>Wace</i>, l. 13,807.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>It was also used to indicate any danger into which the
leader might have fallen. Thus, when Philip Augustus
was unhorsed at the battle of Bovines, Rigord tells us
that his standard-bearer signified the king's peril by depressing
the Royal Standard several times over the spot.</p>

<p>The Dragon-standard, of which we have seen some examples
in our first division, is still found among the
Germans and the English. We have already observed
its exact form in the pictures of Harold in the Bayeux
tapestry. It accompanied the hosts of Richard C&#339;ur-de-Lion.
Richard of Devizes, in recording the attack upon
the "Griffones" at Messina, says: "The king of England
proceeded in arms: the terrible standard of the Dragon
is borne in front; while, behind the king, the sound of
the trumpet excites the army<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>." Hoveden, under date
1191, tells us that Richard "delivered <i>his Dragon</i> (<i>Draconem
suum</i>) to be borne by Peter de Pratellis." Guillaume
le Breton, in the <i>Philippidos</i>, gives to the Emperor
Otho a standard formed of a dragon and an eagle.</p>

<p>The Car-standard, or Carrocium, of the English king
Stephen has already been noticed in the sketch of the
battle of Cuton Moor, (p. <a href="#Page_107">107</a>.) The Carrocio of the
Milanese was still regarded as their Palladium.</p>

<p>Banners were carried by knights banneret, by the
Church Advocati, and by the Town troops, or Communitates
Parochiarum. The knight's banner, as we have
already seen, was square; and, as soon as heraldic devices
became settled, was ensigned with the bearing of
the leader to whom it belonged. Its especial use was to
muster and to rally the troops of the banneret:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Cil treis orent treis gunfanuns,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A ralier lur cumpaingnuns."&mdash;<i>Rom. de Rou</i>, i. 337.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Bishops and abbots appointed knights to defend their
possessions, to lead their contingent, and to fight under
their banner. These advocati in time made their office
hereditary. The Counts of Vexin were the <i>avouÃ©s</i> of the
Abbey of St. Denis, and the lands of Vexin coming into
the possession of the kings of France, these monarchs
acquired the office of bannerers of the abbey. Thus the
plain red flag of St. Denis became, under the name of
the Oriflamme, the most distinguished banner of the
French monarchy.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"L'Oriflamme est une Banniere,<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>It was Louis le Gros who united the county of Vexin
to the crown of France<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>
<p>A very curious variety of the knightly banner occurs
on the twelfth plate of the Bayeux tapestry; the flag is
semicircular, is ensigned with a bird within a bordure,
and has a fringe at the edge. Mr. Worsaae has suggested
that this bird, which appears on the Norman side, may
be the Raven of the Old-Northmen, retained by their
descendants in honour of the deeds of their forefathers.</p>

<p>The banners of the communal troops bore the effigies
of Saints, each parish gathering round the flag on which
its particular saint was portrayed. This usage was as old
as the time of Louis VI. of France: "Tunc ergo communitas
in Francia popularis instituta est a prÃ¦sulibus, ut
presbyteri commitarentur Regi ad obsidionem vel pugnam
cum Vexillis et parochianis omnibus<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>."</p>

<p>The word Gonfanon, Guntfano, so frequently occurring
in the writings of this period, seems to be indifferently
applied to the leader's standard, the knightly banner, and
the lance-flag. It has been derived from the German
<i>kunden</i>, indicare, and <i>Fahne</i>, vexillum; or from <i>Fahne</i>
and the Old-Scandinavian <i>Gunna</i>, pr&#339;lium. Mr. Kemble
inclines to the latter derivation; see glossary to <i>Beowulf</i>,
in v. <i>Guth</i>. A capitulary of Charles the Bald gives the
name of Gonfanon to the banner of the Church vassals:
"Let our envoys (missi nostri) see that the troops of
every bishop, abbot, and abbess, march forth properly
equipped, and with their Gonfalonier (cum Guntfannonario)."
The standard sent by the pope to William the
Conqueror is by Wace named a gonfanon:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"L'Apostoile<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Un gonfanon li envÃ©ia."&mdash;<i>Line</i> 11,450.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>
<p>He gives it also to the barons and more powerful captains:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"N'i a riche home ne baron<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ki n'ait lez lui son gonfanon;<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>In the following passages, it is the lance-flag:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Les lances bessent, o sont li gonfanon."&mdash;<i>Rom. de Garin.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Baisse la lance ou li gonfanon pent."&mdash;<i>Rom. d'Aubery.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Moult si siest bien au col la lance au gonfanon."<br /></span>
<span class="i39"><i>Rom. de Duguesclin.</i><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Pennon, as we have before seen, (p. <a href="#Page_95">95</a>,) was the
flag of those knights who had not attained to the dignity
of banneret. It appears to have terminated in a point
or points, but its exact form at this period has not been
ascertained. It probably differed in nothing but its size
from the lance-flags seen in the Bayeux tapestry and on
the seals and other monuments of the eleventh and
twelfth centuries. Wace, however, in the following passage,
seems to use the word in a more general sense; for
it is the Vicomte du Cotentin, lieutenant of the duke of
Normandy, of whom he is speaking:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Les li fist un penun porter,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">U lur gent pussent recuvrer."&mdash;<i>Rom. de Rou</i>, l. 7839.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>If these various flags were found sufficient to keep together
the troops of an ordinary expedition; in large armaments
such as those of the Crusades, the want of some
more general distinction must soon have been felt. Hoveden
therefore tells us, under the year 1188, that the
leaders against the Saracens, "for the purpose of recognising
their various nations, adopted distinguishing signs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
for themselves and their people. For the king of France
and his people wore red crosses; the king of England
and his people, white crosses; while Philip, earl of
Flanders, and his followers, wore green crosses." The
existence of a mode of recognition among troops at this
period is confirmed by the passage of Wace in which
he names the "cognoissances" of the Norman host and
their allies:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"E tuit orent fet cognoissances,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ke Normant altre conÃ©ust,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Et k'entreposture n'Ã©ust.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ke Normant altre ne fÃ©rist,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ne Franceiz altre n'ocÃ©ist."&mdash;<i>Line</i> 12,816.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The particular nature of the sign of recognition intended
by the chronicler, it is in vain now to inquire. The note
of M. Pluquet on the passage gives "Signes de convention."</p>

<p>The Lance-flag is found throughout the period now
under notice. Many examples occur in the Bayeux tapestry,
and in the royal and baronial seals of the time.
The usual device upon it is a cross, a square, a number
of rounds, or stripes of different colours; or the streamer
is of a single tint. It is dentated in two or more cuts,
and sometimes fringed at the edge. See our engraved
examples.</p>

<p>The Musical Instruments used in war were the horn,
the trumpet, and a variety of the latter called the <i>graisle</i>.
Wace mentions all these in his account of the battle of
Hastings:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Dez ke li dous ost<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> s'entrevirent,<br /></span>

</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>
<p>The horn of battle of this period is very clearly figured
on folio 25 of Harleian MS. 603, a work of the close of
the eleventh century. It is of the common semicircular
form. The trumpet (boisine: buccina) is found, though
in a monument of somewhat later date, on the inscribed
slab of "Godefrey le Troumpour," now preserved in the
library of the London Guildhall<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>. Compare also our
woodcut, No. <a href="#i_312.jpg">73</a>. The graisle (from <i>gracilis</i>) was, as its
name indicates, of a slender form; its exact fashion has
not been ascertained.</p>

<p>The Horse-furniture presents some new features; especially
in the arming of the steed in chain-mail, a practice
which appears to have originated towards the close of the
twelfth century. Wace indeed tells us that William
Fitz-Osbert, at the field of Hastings, rode a steed thus
accoutred:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<span class="i1">Son cheval tot covert de fer."&mdash;<i>Line</i> 12,627.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But we may well believe that it was rather the necessity
of a rhyme to "Osber" than the usage of the period, that
gives us this iron horse at so early a date. Wace, writing
in the second half of the twelfth century, appears
merely to have availed himself of the usual license of
middle-age authorities: to depict a past generation in the
lineaments of his own. The practice of arming the horse
does not seem to have become general till towards the
close of the thirteenth century. A pictorial example of
the trapper of chain-mail will be found in our woodcut,
No. <a href="#i_369.jpg">86</a>. The Saddle had a high pommel and cantle, as
may be seen in our engravings of the royal seals of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
period. In many examples of the Bayeux tapestry they
form volutes, (viewed laterally,) exactly like the sides of
an Ionic capital. The saddle-cloth does not appear in
this tapestry, but it is found on the second seal of Henry
I., on the seal of King Stephen, and on that of Louis
VII. of France. In these examples it is quite plain; but
later it acquires an ornamental character, as in the seal
of Conan, duke of Britanny, c. 1165, (woodcut <a href="#i_167.jpg">41</a>). It is
of a more enriched pattern in the Great Seal of Henry
II., here given.</p>

<p>From Wace we learn that the girths and breastplate
were named, in the "Romance" of that day, <i>cingles</i> and
<i>poitrail</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Li peitral del cheval rompi,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">E li dui cengles altresi."&mdash;<i>Rom. de Rou</i>, l. 14,674.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This poitrail has generally, in the period under examination,
pendants attached to it, in the form of rounds,&mdash;perhaps
grelots. See woodcuts <a href="#i_026.jpg">1</a>, <a href="#i_119.jpg">25</a>, <a href="#i_146.jpg">28</a> and <a href="#i_148.jpg">29</a>.</p>

<p>Roman monuments offer similar examples, as in Trajan's
Column, the Pillar of Antonine, and other remains,
where the pendants are bells, crescents, trefoils, rounds,
and guttÃ¦. Such collars are found also in the paintings
of the Ajunta Caves, where bells and rounds alternate.
This monument is assigned to the first century of our
era. In the curious Spanish manuscript, dated 1109, in
the British Museum, Addit. MSS., 11,695, the circular
pendants occur, attached not only to the poitrail, but to
the saddle (fol. 223). The Bits used for the war-horse
have long cheeks, which are often of an ogee form. The
rein is generally quite plain, though sometimes ornamented
with studs, as in examples in the manuscript
last cited.</p>

<p>The Spur was still of a single goad, and fastened by a
single strap. The form of the goad offers some variety:
it is leaf-shaped, conical, lozenge-shaped, and sometimes
consists of a ball from which springs a short spike. A
variety is fashioned into a sort of button, having a slender
spike in the centre. The first three kinds are seen in the
Bayeux tapestry and many of the seals of the period.
The ball-and-spike spur is well shewn in the effigies
of Henry II. and Richard I. at Fontevraud, figured by
Stothard in his "Monuments." The last variety may
be seen in Addit. MS. 11,695, fol. 223. The shank of
the spur is sometimes straight, as in Anglo-Saxon times:
sometimes curved. The curved form appears in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
sculptured effigies of King Henry II. and Richard I.
The spur of Richard the First seems to have been attached
to the strap by rivets.</p>

<p>The Caltrop, or <i>tribulus</i>, an instrument derived from
classic times, was in use, but not of frequent employment.
Anna Comnena tells us that the Emperor Alexis
strewed them in the path of the French cavalry; and
at a later period, we read of knights fixing their spurs
point upwards in the way of their advancing enemy, after
the manner of caltrops: but this cruel device appears to
have been practised very rarely, and we may venture to
believe that it was generally discountenanced as beneath
the dignity and generosity of true chivalry. At a later
period, caltrops were used to strew over the slope of a
breach, to impede the advance of a storming party.</p>

<p>From a very curious passage in the <i>Roman de Rou</i>, we
learn that the knight sometimes went to battle <i>tied to his
saddle</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Li reis aveit un soldÃ©ier,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Brun out nom, novel chevalier.<br /></span>

<span class="i1">E par li coisses fu liez," &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Line</i> 16,064.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>However strange such a device may appear, the mention
of it by other ancient writers forbids us to regard it as
a mere vagary of the poet. Matthew Paris, under the
year 1243, recounting the irruption of the Tartars into
Europe, says: "They have horses, not large, but very
strong, and that require but little food, and they bind
themselves firmly on their backs." And, in the fifteenth
century, the writer of the life of Earl Richard
of Warwick tells us that, at a justing-match, his hero<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
was obliged to dismount from his horse, because some
of his adversaries had accused him of being tied in his
saddle.</p>

<p>For the Horse itself, Spain appears to have been in
the highest favour for the purity of its breed. Walter
Giffard had brought from Gallicia the steed on which
Duke William rode at the field of Hastings:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>And in the well-known passage of the Monk of Marmoustier,
where he describes the knighting of Geoffry,
duke of Normandy, we are told that the young hero was
"mounted upon a Spanish horse, which had been presented
by the king."</p>

<p>How the horses of the knights were conveyed in ships
and disembarked from the vessels, is curiously shewn in
the ninth and tenth plates of the Bayeux tapestry.</p>

<p>Of the <span class="smcap">Engines</span> employed in sieges, all those mentioned
in our first division appear to have been still in
use. The ancient Vinea (Cat or Sow) is frequently mentioned,
and the moveable Tower, or <i>Beffroi</i>, becomes a
prominent feature in all the great siege operations of
this century. William of Malmesbury has left us an
excellent description of these two contrivances in his
account of the siege of Jerusalem<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There was one engine which we call the Sow, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
ancients, Vinea; because the machine, which is constructed
of slight timbers, the roof covered with boards
and wicker-work, and the sides defended with undressed
hides, protects those who are within; who, after the
manner of a sow, proceed to undermine the foundations
of the walls. There was another, which, for want of
timber, was but a moderate-sized tower, constructed
after the manner of houses. They call it Berefreid<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>.
This was intended to equal the walls in height. And
now the fourteenth day of July arrived, when some
began to undermine the wall with the Sows, others to
move forward the Tower. To do this more conveniently,
they took it toward the works in separate pieces<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>, and
putting it together again at such a distance as to be out
of bowshot, advanced it on wheels nearly close to the
wall. Meantime the slingers with stones, the archers
with arrows, and the crossbow-men with bolts, each intent
on his own department, began to press forward and
dislodge their opponents from the ramparts. Soldiers,
too, unmatched in courage, ascend the Tower, waging
nearly equal war against the enemy with missile weapons
and with stones. Nor indeed were our foes at
all remiss, but trusting their whole security to their
valour, they poured down boiling grease and oil upon
the Tower, and slung stones on the soldiers, rejoicing in
the completion of their desires by the destruction of
multitudes. During the whole of that day the battle
was such that neither party seemed to think they had
been worsted. On the following, the business was decided:
for the Franks, becoming more experienced from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
the event of the attack of the preceding day, threw
faggots flaming with oil on a tower adjoining the wall,
and on those who defended it; which, blazing by the
action of the wind, first seized the timber, and then the
stones, and drove off the garrison. Moreover, the beams
which the Turks had left hanging down from the walls,
in order that, being forcibly drawn back, they might, by
their recoil, batter the Tower in pieces, in case it should
advance too near, were by the Franks dragged to them,
by cutting away the ropes; and being placed from the
engine to the wall, and covered with hurdles, they
formed a bridge of communication from the Tower to
the ramparts. Thus what the infidels had contrived
for their defence, became the means of their destruction;
for then the enemy, dismayed by the smoking
masses of flame, and by the courage of our soldiers,
began to give way. These, advancing on the wall, and
thence into the city, manifested the excess of their joy
by the strenuousness of their exertions."</p>

<p>William of Tyre mentions also the use of the beffroi at
the siege of Jerusalem; adding that the side towards the
city was so constructed that a portion of it might be let
down, after the manner of a drawbridge, thus enabling
the assailants to enter upon the walls<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>. Philippe Auguste
frequently employed this engine. At the siege of
ChÃ¢teau-Roux, in Berry,&mdash;</p>

<span class="i1">Turribus alta magis et m&#339;nibus."&mdash;<i>Philippidos</i>, lib. ii.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And again, at the siege of Radepont, in Normandy:
"Erectis in circuitu <i>Turribus</i> ligneis <i>ambulatoriis</i>, aliisque
tormentis quam plurimis viriliter impugnavit et c&#339;pit<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>King Richard I. constructed also in Sicily a wooden
tower, which he afterwards carried with him to the
Holy Land. After forcing the city of Messina, "the
king," says Richard of Devizes, "having but little confidence
in the natives, built a new wooden tower of great
strength and height by the walls of the city, which, to
the reproach of the Griffones, (Greeks,) he called <i>Mate-griffun</i>,"
(sub an. 1190). In 1191, "the king of England,
about to leave Sicily, caused the tower which he
had built to be taken down, and stowed the whole of the
materials in his ships, to take along with him." And
"on the third day after his arrival at the siege of Acre,"
continues Richard of Devizes, "the king caused his
wooden tower, which he had named 'Mate-griffun' when
it was made in Sicily, to be built and set up; and before
the dawn of the fourth day the machine stood erect by
the walls of Acre, and from its height looked down upon
the city beneath. And by sunrise were thereon archers
casting missiles without ceasing against the Turks and
Thracians."</p>

<p>The name <i>Mate-griffon</i> appears to be derived from the
favourite game of the courtly in these days; "donner
eschec et mat" being equivalent to the "check-mate" of
our modern chess-players. Ordericus Vitalis has a passage
curiously illustrative of this subject: "Castrum
condere c&#339;pit, quod Mataputenam, id est, devincens
meretricem, pro despectu HaduissÃ¦ ComitissÃ¦, nuncupavit<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>."</p>

<p>In 1160, the Emperor Frederick besieging Crema, in
Italy, employed the beffroi, filling it with chosen troops.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
He placed crossbowmen on the upper story, in order that,
shooting down upon the walls, they might clear the parapet
of its defenders; while, from the lower stage, soldiers
of tried boldness might fix their drawbridges on the
wall, and advance to the capture of the city<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>.</p>

<p>At this same city of Crema, in 1159, occurred an act
of patriotism, admirable from the resolution which inspired
it, though terrible in its consequences. The emperor advanced
a Beffroi towards the beleaguered city, in front
of which he placed the youthful hostages whom he had
obtained from the unhappy Cremans, in hopes of thus
forcing the inhabitants to a capitulation. But the citizens,
regardless of all save their liberty, continued to ply their
engines against the tower, though every stone that was
cast forth fell in death among their children<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>.</p>

<p>The siege of Ancona, in 1174, offers another instance
of heroism in connection with the belfragium, more pleasing
in its circumstances. The besieged had been successful
in their endeavours to beat back the towers and
scatter their occupants; but as these latter still kept up
a steady discharge of missiles from a short distance, no
one dared venture beyond the walls to set fire to the deserted
structures. At last a widow named <span class="smcap">Stamura</span>,
seizing a torch, advanced into the plain, and regardless
of the storm of bolts and arrows that fell around her,
steadily achieved the task she had undertaken, and having
set the towers in flames, returned in safety to the
city<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>.</p>

<p>The siege of Ancona is further remarkable for the employment
by the citizens of divers; who succeeded in capturing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
several of the vessels engaged in blockading the
port. Taking advantage of a strong wind blowing from
the sea, the divers contrived to cut the cables of seven of
the Venetian ships, which then drifted helplessly ashore<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>Vinea</i> mentioned in a foregoing extract from
Malmesbury, was called also the Cat. Thus Vegetius:
"Vineas dixerunt veteres, quas nunc militari barbaricoque
usu Cattos vocant<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>." Guillaume le Breton also mentions
this machine and its use:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Huc faciunt reptare Catum, tectique sub illo<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Suffodiunt murum."&mdash;<i>Philipp.</i>, lib. vii.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>While, from the Monk of Vau-de-Cernay we learn that
the contrivance was of small dimensions: "Machinam
quandam parvam, quÃ¦ lingua vulgari Catus dicitur, faciebat
duci ad suffodiendum murum<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>." There were, however,
varieties of the Cat, one of which was used to oppose
the besiegers in the beffroi. Thus Radevicus:
"Magnaque audacia, super muros et in suis machinis quos
Cattas appellant, operiuntur, et cum (oppugnatores) admoverentur
pontes, ipsi eos vel occuparent, vel dejicerent,
murumque scalis ascendere nitentes vario modo deterrent<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>."
And another kind was employed by the assailants
in crossing the ditch<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>.</p>

<p>The Battering-ram, according to Richard of Devizes,
was employed by C&#339;ur-de-Lion at the siege of Messina:
"In the meantime, the king with his troops approached
the gates of the city, which he instantly forced by the
application of the Battering-ram, and entering within,
took possession of every part, even to Tancred's palace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
and the lodgings of the French around their king's quarters,
which he spared out of respect to the king."</p>

<p>Among the stone-throwing machines, the Mangona and
the Mangonella are discriminated as casting, the former
large, the latter smaller stones. The monk Abbo has
already, in his account of the siege of Paris in 886, mentioned
the</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mangana&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Saxa quibus jaciunt <i>ingentia</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Guillaume le Breton, in the <i>Philippidos</i>, tells us:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Interea grossos Petraria mittit ab intus<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Assidue lapides, Mangonellusque <i>minores</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Among the effects recorded of these great projectiles,
we may cite the account of Otto of Frisinga, who tells us
that when the Emperor Frederic attacked Tortona in
1155, a stone was cast from one of the periers of such
magnitude, that, falling before the door of the cathedral,
where three of the principal citizens were in deliberation
on the best means of defending the city, it killed them
all<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>.</p>

<p>The term <i>mangonneaux</i> is sometimes applied to the
stones or other missiles discharged by the instrument.
From the name <i>mangona</i> our word <i>gun</i> appears to be
derived: a supposition that seems strengthened by the
fact that the earliest "gonnes," like the mangonÃ¦, were
employed to cast stones.</p>

<p>The terrors of the balistÃ¦ were occasionally aggravated
by their being made the instruments of a special
vengeance. Thus Malmesbury informs us that, at the
siege of Antioch in 1097, the Turks, irritated by losses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
sustained from the besieging Crusaders, "wreaked their
indignation on the Syrian and Armenian inhabitants
of the city; throwing, by means of their balistÃ¦ and
petraries, the heads of those whom they had slain into
the camp of the Franks, that by such means they might
lacerate their feelings." A somewhat similar incident is
reported by Froissart in his account of the siege of Thun
l'EvÃªque in 1327<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>; so that these cruelties do not appear
to be mere tales of credulous pilgrims, or inventions of
monkish chroniclers.</p>

<p>Forts of wood were of occasional employment, the
materials of which were transported from place to place,
so that the structure might be speedily raised. Wace
gives us a description of that brought over by William
the Conqueror, and built up at Hastings:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Donc ont des nÃ©s mairrien<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> getÃ©,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">En ont un chastelet fermÃ©."&mdash;<i>Line</i> 11,658.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Mines were in use both by Richard I. and Philippe
Auguste. At the siege of Acre in 1191, Richard attacked
the city with archers and balistÃ¦: "But more important
than these," adds Devizes, "were the miners, making
themselves a way beneath the ground, sapping the foundation
of the walls, while soldiers bearing shields, having
planted ladders, sought an entrance over the ramparts."
The French king employed the mine at the siege of the
Castle of Boves, as we learn from William the Breton.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
See also Rigord, page 185. The mines of these days
were large caverns in which pillars of wood supported
the incumbent mass. The posts being smeared with
pitch and surrounded with combustibles, fire was then
brought, and the stanchions being consumed, the walls
fell in. With the mine came the counter-mine; an example
of which occurs in the description by Guillaume
le Breton of the siege of ChÃ¢teau-Gaillard; where the
English, countermining against the French, met them
in their works and drove them back with slaughter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Suffodiunt murum. Sed non minus hostis ab illÃ¢<br /></span>

<span class="i1">RetrÃ² minatores telis compellit abire."&mdash;<i>Philipp.</i>, lib. vii.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Later, challenges were made, to be fought out in the
mines, the combatants contending over a barrier of
wood fixed in the midst. And Upton tells us that the
aspirant to knighthood in a besieging army, no church
being at hand, performed in the mine his vigil of arms.</p>

<p>While the besieging force plied their attack by means
of the engines and mines already noticed, they had begun,
in imitation of the ancients, to construct lines of
circumvallation; in order at once to cut off the citizens
from all communication with the open country, and to
defend themselves against the sorties of the town. An
example of this may be seen in the siege of Crema by
the Emperor Frederic in 1159<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>.</p>

<p>Under the general name of Hastilude (spear-play)
were in use several kinds of <span class="smcap">military exercises</span>: the
joust, the tourney and the behourd. "Torneamenta,
justas, burdeicias, <i>sive alia</i> Hastiluda<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>." The joust and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
the tourney were, in their primary sense, mere modes of
attack. The joust was the charge of a single horseman
against a single antagonist. The tourney was the onset
of a troop, who, having made their charge, turned back
to acquire the necessary speed for a fresh attack. At
the siege of Rouen&mdash;</p>

<p>The Behourd (<i>Bohordicum</i>) was an exercise with lance
and target, of which the distinctive character has not
been ascertained. "Trepidare quoque, quod vulgariter
<i>biordare</i> dicitur, cum <i>scuto et lancea</i> aliquis clericus publicÃ¨
non attentet<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>."</p>

<p>Military games, whose object was to familiarize the
soldier in time of peace with the usages of war, had
been long known. They were practised in classic times:
they were in vogue, as Tacitus tells us, among the ancient
Germans: they were pursued in Germany, as we
learn from Nithard<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>, in the ninth century. But that
splendid and costly image of battle called a Tournament
is not found earlier than the epoch which we are now
considering. Several nations lay claim to its invention,
but none offer such good proofs as the French. The
Chronicle of Tours expressly says, under the year 1066:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
"Gaufridus de Pruliaco (Preulli), qui torneamenta invenit,
apud Andegavum occiditur." And the Chronicle
of St. Martin of Tours has a similar passage: "Anno
Henrici Imp. VII. et Philippi Regis VI. fuit proditio
apud Andegavum, ubi Gaufridus de Pruliaco et <i>alii
barones</i> occisi sunt. Hic Gaufridus torneamenta invenit."
Matthew Paris, again, names the tournament
"conflictus Gallicus." And Ralph of Coggeshall has:
"Dum, more Francorum, cum hastis vel contis sese
cursim equitantes vicissim impeterent."</p>

<p>Tournaments seem to have first obtained favour in
England in the troublous times of Stephen<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>. They were,
however, discountenanced by Henry II., and the young
aspirants to military renown were forced to seek in
other lands the opportunity of distinguishing themselves.
"Tyronum exercitiis in Anglia prorsus inhibitis,
qui forte armorum affectantes gloriam exerceri
volebant, transfretantes, in terrarum exercebantur confiniis<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>."
Under Richard I. they again began to flourish,
and from that time to the end of the middle ages,
though often discountenanced by kings and churchmen,
they enjoyed the highest favour among all who practised
or admired knightly deeds and military splendour.
"After the return of King Richard to England," says
Jocelin of Brakelond, under the year 1194, "licence was
granted for holding tournaments; for which purpose
many knights met between Thetford and St. Edmund's,
but the Abbot forbade them. They, however, in spite
of the Abbot, fulfilled their desire. On another occasion,
there came fourscore young men with their followers,
sons of noblemen, to have their revenge at the aforesaid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
place; which being done, they returned into the town
to put up there. The Abbot hearing of this, ordered
the gates to be locked, and all of them to be kept
within. The next day was the vigil of Peter and Paul
the Apostles. Therefore, having promised that they
would not go forth, they all dined with the Abbot on
that day. But, after dinner, the Abbot having retired
to his chamber, they all arose and began to carol and
sing, sending into the town for wine, drinking and then
screeching, depriving the Abbot and convent of their
sleep, and doing everything in scorn of the Abbot;
spending the day, until the evening, in this manner,
and refusing to desist, even when the Abbot commanded
them. When the evening was come, they broke open
the gates of the town and went forth bodily. The
Abbot, indeed, solemnly excommunicated them all, yet
not without having first consulted Hubert, at that time
justiciary; and many of them came, promising amendment
and seeking absolution."</p>

<p>The more regular tournaments, however, were controlled
by royal ordinances. They were restricted in
England to five localities: namely, between Sarum and
Wilton, between Warwick and Kenilworth, between
Stamford and Wallingford, between Brakeley and Mixeberg,
and between Blie and Tykehill. And, as nothing
in these days could be done without a fine to the king
or a tax to the pope, every earl had to pay twenty marks
for his privilege to appear as a combatant; every baron,
ten; every knight having a landed estate, four; each
knight without such estate, two; and all foreigners were
excluded<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>.</p>

<p>In France, under Philip Augustus, tournaments appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
to have been held on a large scale, as PÃ¨re Daniel has remarked,
from the incident of Philip having suddenly procured
at an assemblage of this kind, troops sufficient to
repel an unexpected attack on AlenÃ§on<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>.</p>

<p>It is not within the province (if it were in the limits)
of this work, to give any detailed account of tournaments
and their usages; for at this period and long after, the
defensive armour used for the joust (as shewn by the
pictorial monuments of the time) differed in no respect
from that worn in battle<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>.</p>

<p>In the curious sketch of London in the twelfth century
by Fitzstephen, an eye-witness of the incidents he
records, we have a spirited notice of the military exercises
of the young citizens in these days. "Every
Sunday in Lent, after dinner, a company of young men
go into the fields, mounted on war-horses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">----in equis certamine primis:<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>each of which</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Aptus et in gyros currere doctus equus.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The lay sons of the citizens rush out of the gates in
crowds, equipped with lances and shields (<i>lanceis et
scutis militaribus</i>); the more youthful with blunt spears;
and they engage in sham fights and exercise themselves
in military combats. When the king happens to be
near the city, most of the courtiers attend, and the
varlets (<i>ephebi</i>) of the households of earls and barons
who have not yet attained knighthood, resort thither
to try their skill. The hope of victory animates every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
one. The spirited horses neigh; their limbs tremble;
they champ the bit; impatient of delay, they fret and
paw the ground. When at length</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">----sonipedum rapit ungula cursum,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>the young riders, having been divided into companies,
some pursue their fellows, but are unable to overtake
them; others push their companions out of the course
and gallop beyond them.</p>

<p>"In the Easter holidays they have a game resembling
a naval conflict. A target is fastened to a post
in the middle of the river: in the prow of a boat,
driven along by oars and the current, stands a young
man who is to strike the target with his lance: if, in
hitting it, he break his lance and keep his position unmoved,
he gains his point, his wish is fulfilled; but if
his lance be not broken by the blow, he is tumbled into
the river and his boat passes by. Two boats, however,
are placed there, one on each side of the target, and in
them a number of young men, to take up the tilter when
he emerges from the stream. On the bridge and in
chambers by the river-side, stand the spectators:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">----multum ridere parati.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>"During the Summer holidays the young men exercise
themselves in leaping, in archery, wrestling, stone-throwing,
casting javelins beyond a mark, and in fighting
with shields."</p>

<p>In the Winter, skaters, "binding under their feet the
shin-bones of some animal, take in their hands poles shod
with iron, which at times they strike against the ice, and
are thus carried along with the rapidity of a bird on the
wing, or a bolt discharged from a cross-bow. Sometimes
two of the skaters having by mutual agreement placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
themselves far apart, come together from opposite sides:
they meet, and with their poles strike each other: one
or both fall, not without some bodily hurt: even after
their fall, they are carried along to a great distance from
each other by the velocity of the motion; and whatever
part of their heads comes in contact with the ice, is laid
bare to the very skull. Frequently the leg or arm of
the person who falls, if he chance to light on either,
is broken. But youth is an age eager for glory and
desirous of victory: thus, in order to distinguish themselves
in real fight, these tyros contend with so much
boldness in counterfeit battle."</p>

<p>Among the exercises glanced at in this sketch of the
Londoner's sportive year, the Quintain is conspicuous.
This was especially the game of the "non-noble," and
might be practised either on horseback or on foot. The
more ancient quintain was merely a post or a shield
fixed on a pole, which the tyro attacked in lieu of a
living antagonist. But a new element was soon given
to the quintain, which at once brought it into favour
with the populace: it was so contrived as to inflict summary
punishment on the inexpert. To one kind, a bag
of sand was fastened, which, whirling round from the
force of the blow struck at the opposite end, buffeted
the tilter who was not expeditious enough to get out
of its way. Others were made in the form of a Turk,
armed with sword and shield; and these, moving on a
pivot as before, inflicted a smart blow on the lagging
assailant. In another variety, a large tub of water was
fixed on a post, which discharged its contents on the
person of any clumsy jouster. Other kinds are described
and figured in Strutt's Sports. And in the little village
of Offham, in Kent, may still be seen an example of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
quintain, which is fixed "opposite to the dwelling-house
of the estate, which is bound to keep it up<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>." It now
consists of a post, having a cross-piece moving on a
pivot, terminating at one end with a broad perforated
board, and at the other with a pendent log of wood.
The log, however, seems to have been substituted for
a "bag of sand," which is mentioned in old accounts
of this relic.</p>

<p>"Besides the practice of feats of arms," says John
of Salisbury, writing in the reign of Henry II., "the
young knight should qualify himself for the duties of
his station by a variety of toil and exemplary abstinence.
From the beginning he must learn to labour, run, carry
heavy weights, and bear the sun and dust: he must use
sparing and rustic food: he must accustom himself to
live in tents, or in the open air." Then, turning upon
the luxurious and effeminate knights of his day, he upbraids
them in a diatribe which gives us a singular
picture of the manners of this age. "Some," he says,
"think that military glory consists in the display of
elegant dress, in wearing their clothes tight to the body,
so binding on their linen or silken garments that they
seem a skin coloured like their flesh. Sitting softly on
their ambling horses, they think themselves so many
Apollos. If you make an army of them, you will have
the camp of ThaÃ¯s, not of Hannibal. Each is boldest in
the banqueting-hall, but in the battle every one desires
to be the last: they would rather assail the enemy with
arrows than come to close fighting. Returning home
without a scar, they sing triumphantly of their battles,
and boast of the thousand deaths that wandered near
their temples. If diligent idleness can procure any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
spears, which, being brittle as hemp, should chance to
be broken in the field; if a piece of gold, minium, or
any colour of the rainbow, by any chance or blow should
fall out of their shields; their garrulous tongues would
make it an everlasting memorial. They have the first
places at supper. They feast every day splendidly, if
they can afford it, but shun labour and exercise like a
dog or a snake. Whatever is surrounded with difficulty,
they leave to those who serve them. In the meantime,
they so gild their shields, and so adorn their tents, that
you would think each one, not a learner, but a chieftain
of war<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>."</p>

<h3><a name="PART_III" id="PART_III">PART III.</a></h3>

<h5>THIRTEENTH CENTURY.</h5>


<p>The authorities which throughout the last division of
our inquiry have served us as guides&mdash;seals, vellum-paintings,
metal-chasings, ivory-carvings, and the writings
of chroniclers and poets&mdash;are still available to us: but
in the thirteenth century a new and most valuable source
of information is offered by the numerous knightly effigies
which are found in cathedral and chantry, in wayside
chapel and lofty monastery. These sepulchral figures, of
the proportions of life, are of especial value to the student
of military costume, permitting him to follow his inquiry
into the minutest detail. Not a belt nor a lace, not a
buckle nor a strap, but he can trace the exact form and
assign the particular purpose of it. Whether the effigy
be a statue or "a brass," he finds in it abundant material
for furthering his inquiry; and while from the illuminations
of cotemporary manuscripts he obtains precise information
on the point of <i>colour</i>, in the effigy he sees
the exact moulding of each knightly adjunct, and the
smallest pattern that adorns the smallest ornament of the
knightly equipment. The military brasses of this century
are but few; but the statues, in stone, in wood, or
in Purbeck marble, are scattered through our English
counties in surprising numbers. The value of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
national memorials is beginning to be understood: the
crumbling figure is no longer permitted to perish in the
open churchyard, to lie in fragments among the rubbish
of the belfry corner, to form the ridiculous ornament of
the churchwarden's grotto or the squire's glyptotheck.
With pious care it is restored to the sacred fane from
which it had been abstracted; it again becomes part of
the chancel or chantry beneath whose pavement lie the
bones of him of whom church, chantry, and statue are
alike the monuments. But from the very consideration
which has been newly accorded to these memorials, has
arisen a fresh danger: it has, in some cases, been thought
expedient to submit them to a so-called restoration. They
have been patched up with Roman cement, eked out
with supplementary limbs, plastered over with mock
Purbeck marble. The mistakes that have been committed
in costume, equipment, and art-treatment, are more fit
for the pages of a jest-book than those of a sober treatise;
and it is scarcely necessary to say that, for any purpose
of the historian, the archÃ¦ologist, or even in the more
narrow view of ancestral portraiture, the statue has become,
under such a treatment, utterly valueless. Yet
our task is so simple. We have only to preserve. Inheritors
of the finest series of national ancestral memorials
that Europe can boast, let us at least transmit to after-days,
in all their integrity, the admirable works that
have come down to us through the troubles and turmoils
of seven centuries<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>
<p>Throughout the thirteenth century the feudal and mercenary
<span class="smcap">troops</span> continued to be employed together. But
towards the middle of this period, the Italian cities, combating
for their liberties, began to levy their men-at-arms
from the non-noble class as well as from the knightly;
a force which, under the name of <i>Conduttitij Soldati</i>, obtained
in the next age a very wide celebrity.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i_222.jpg" id="i_222.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/i_222.jpg" alt="No. 47." title="No. 47." />
   <p class="caption3">No. 47.</p>
</div>

<p>Besides the mounted men-at-arms or heavy cavalry,
there were light-horse troops formed by the mounted
archers and cross-bowmen, and the esquires attending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
upon the knights. The example here given is from Roy.
MS. 20, D. 1, fol. 127, a work of the close of the thirteenth
century<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>.</p>

<p>The foot-troops or <i>Sergents de pied</i> consisted principally
of archers, cross-bowmen and spearmen. There were also
the <i>Sergens d'armes</i> or heavy-armed body-guard, Coustillers,
Slingers, Bidaux, and Brigands or Ribauds; to
which may be added the varlets or pages, who followed
their knightly masters into the field, now fighting lustily
in the <i>mÃªlÃ©e</i>, now bearing off the wounded body of their
lord to some place of solace and safety. Clientes and
Satellites were general names given to the inferior troops
of the feudal and communal levy, including both horse
and foot. There was nothing approaching to a uniform
costume for the soldiery, though occasionally we find a
leader seeking to identify his men by some addition to
their dress, as a cross, a scarf, or other similar token. In
1264, Simon de Montford "ordered his troops to fasten
white crosses on their breasts and backs, above their armour,
in order that they might be known by their enemies,
and to shew that they were fighting for justice<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>."
In this case, however, the motive seems to have been,
less the desire of a mark of recognition among friends,
than the assumption, so common in warlike undertakings,
of a holy motive for manslaughter. In the following
passage from Guiart relating to the battle of Mons-en-Puelle,
the object is more distinctly that of friendly recognition:&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Of the Man-at-arms and his barded charger we obtain
an admirable definition from the <i>Chronicon Colmariense</i>
under the year 1298: "Armati reputabantur qui galeas
ferreas in capitibus habebant, et qui wambasia, id est,
tunicam spissam ex lino et stuppa, vel veteribus pannis
consutam, et desuper camisiam ferream, id est, vestem ex
circulis ferreis contextam, per quÃ¦ nulla sagitta poterat
hominem vulnerare. Ex his Armatis centum inermes
mille lÃ¦di potuerunt: habebant et multos qui habebant
dextrarios, id est, equos magnos, qui inter equos communes
quasi Bucephalus Alexandri, inter alios eminebat.
Hi equi cooperti fuerunt coopertoriis ferreis, id est, veste
ex circulis ferreis, contexta. Assessores dextrariorum
habebant loricas ferreas: habebant et caligas, manipulos
ferreos, et in capitibus galeas ferreas splendidas et ornatas,
et alia multa quÃ¦ me tÃ¦duit enarrare." The
armour of these sturdy warriors we shall presently examine
piece by piece.</p>

<p>The <i>Sergens Ã  pied</i> (<i>Servientes</i>) included the mass of
the troops beneath the knightly dignity. Guillaume
Guiart arms them with the lance and crossbow:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"&mdash;&mdash;bon serjanz i a<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A arbaletes et a lances."<br /></span>
<span class="i8"><i>Chronique MÃ©trique</i>, 2<sup>e</sup>. partie, vers 8567.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And the same weapons are assigned to those levied by
the <i>ordonnance</i> of Philip of France in 1303: "Et seront
armÃ©s les sergens de pie de pourpoint et de hauberjons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
gamboison, de bacinez et de lances: Et des six, il y en
aura deux arbalestriers<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>."</p>

<p>The <i>Sergens d'armes</i>, (<i>Servientes Armorum</i>,) whose establishment
in the twelfth century we have already observed,
(page <a href="#Page_100">100</a>,) continued to form the royal body-guard
throughout the present age. In 1214 they especially
distinguished themselves at the battle of Bovines,
as we find recorded by the monument (before noticed) in
the church of St. Catherine. The inscription of the monument,
though itself not earlier than the beginning of the
fifteenth century, probably relates very exactly the circumstances
of their victory, and of the foundation of the
church. It is as follows:&mdash;"A la priere des Sergens
darmes Mons<sup>r</sup>. Saint Loys fonda ceste Eglise et y mist la
premiere pierre: Et fu pour la joie de la vittoire qui fu
au Pont de Bouines lan Mil. <span class="smcap">cc</span> et <span class="smcap">xiiii</span>. Les Sergens
darmes pour le temps gardoient ledit pont et vouerent
que se Dieu leur donnoit vittoire ils fonderoient une
eglise en lonneur de Madame Sainte Katherine. Et
ainsi fu il." A statute of Philippe le Bel in 1285
limits the number of these guards attending the court to
thirty: "Item, Sergens d'armes, trente, lesquels seront
Ã  Cour sans plus." From the same statute we learn that
one of their weapons at this time was the crossbow: "Ils
porteront toujours leurs carquois pleins de carreaux."</p>

<p>The Archer was becoming every day of more importance
in the field; and if the bow was an efficient arm in
battle, it was still more so in sieges, and the defence of
strongholds and mountain-passes. From various Statutes
of Arms we find that a portion of the military tenants are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
ordered to be provided with the longbow and arrows.
The Statute of Winchester, in 1285, directs that each
man "a quaraunte soudeesz de terre e de plus jeqs a cent
souz, eit en sa mesun espe, ark, setes e cutel.... E tuz
lez autres qui aver pount, eient arcs e setes hors de forestes,
e dedenz forestes arcs e piles." Compare the statute
of the 36th year of Henry III., printed in the <i>Additamenta</i>
of the History of Matthew Paris<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>. The costume
of the ordinary archer, defended only by his <i>chapel de
fer</i>, appears to be depicted in our woodcut, No. <a href="#i_232.jpg">50</a>, from
Harleian MS. 4751, fol. 8, written at the commencement
of this century. That the English occasionally mixed
their bowmen with the cavalry, we have the express testimony
of Matthew Paris: "Viri autem sagittarii gentis
Anglorum equitibus permixti."
In many illuminations
of this time
they appear fully armed
in hauberk and helm,
as in the miniature here
given from Royal MS.
20, D. 1, fol. 307. See
also our woodcut, No.
<a href="#i_340.jpg">82</a>, a group from the
Painted Chamber of the
palace at Westminster,
where the archer wears
a hauberk and coif of
chain-mail. These examples
of heavy-armed bowmen are fully borne out by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
written testimony. We have already observed Richard
C&#339;ur-de-Lion plying his arrows under the walls of Lincoln,
(p. <a href="#Page_157">157</a>); and Otto Morena has, "Ipse Imperator
optime sciens sagittare, multos de Cremensibus interfecit."
(p. <a href="#Page_58">58</a>.) For further pictorial examples of archers
of this century, see Royal MS. 2, B. vi. fol. 10; and 20,
D. i. ff. 60, 87, 150 and 285.</p>

<p>By a curious volume of "Proverbs" of the thirteenth
century, printed from a manuscript of that date in the
<i>Vie privÃ©e des FranÃ§ois</i><a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>, we learn that "the best archers
are in Anjou." Other proverbial celebrities of this
manuscript are: Chevaliers de Champagne, Ecuyers
de Bourgogne, Sergens de Hainaut, Champions d'Eu,
Ribauds de Troyes.</p>

<p>The provision of an equipped archer to attend the
king in his wars, is the frequent sergeantry for lands at
this time; and the particulars attached to the service
occasionally partake of that whimsicality found in other
tenures of the period. It is curious also to trace the
changes which these charters undergo in a small lapse of
years, as they come under the inspection of the jurors
appointed to enforce their engagements. Thus, the service
for the manor of Faintree, in Shropshire, in 1211, is
"a foot-soldier, with a bow and arrows, for the king's
army in Wales." In 1274 the soldier is bound to stay
with the host only "till he has shot away his arrows."
In 1284 the archer has "to attend the king in his Welsh
wars, with a bow, three arrows, and a 'terpolus<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>.'" This
terpolus, or tribulus, was probably an "archer's stake,"
not the mere small iron <i>caltrop</i>, of which the provision of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
one only by each archer would be of little use in impeding
a charge of cavalry. The duty of the bowman who
had only to stay in the field till he had shot away three
arrows was sufficiently easy; but on other occasions the
archer did not escape so lightly. The manor of Chetton,
co. Salop, supplies in 1283 an archer for the king's host
in Wales, who is to take with him a flitch of bacon, and
to remain with the army till he has eaten it all up<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>The Cross-bowman was an essential
component of the host
during all this period. He was
in the van of battle. "Balistarii
semper prÃ¦ibant," says Matthew
Paris<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>; and there is scarcely a
conflict mentioned by this chronicler
in which the arbalester does
not play a conspicuous part. In
the battle near Damietta, in 1237,
"more than a hundred knights of
the Temple fell, and three hundred cross-bowmen (<i>arcubalistarii</i>),
not including some other seculars, and a
large number of foot-soldiers<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>." The Emperor Frederic
in 1239, giving an account of his Italian campaign to
the king of England, writes: "After we had by our
knights and cross-bowmen reduced all the province of
Liguria<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>," &amp;c. In 1242 the Count de la Marche, refusing
to do homage to Amphulse, the brother of the
French king, "swelling with anger and with loud threats,
accompanied by his wife Isabella and surrounded by a
body of soldiers, broke through the midst of the Poictevin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
cross-bowmen, and having set fire to the house
in which he had dwelt, suddenly mounted a horse and
took to flight<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>." St. Louis, marching to meet the English
in Poitou, had an army in which there were "about four
thousand knights splendidly armed to the teeth, besides
numbers of others, who came from all directions, flocking
to the army, like rivers flowing into the sea; and the
number of retainers and cross-bowmen was said to be
about twenty thousand<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>." The opposing forces of the
English king consisted of "sixteen hundred knights,
twenty thousand foot-soldiers, and seven hundred arbalesters."</p>

<p>The Cross-bowmen were of several kinds, some mounted,
some on foot. The mounted balistarii in King John's
time were those possessing one horse, those having two
horses (<i>ad duos equos</i><a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>), and others having three horses<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>.
In 1205 the king sends to the sheriff of Salop, "Peter, a
balister of three horses, and nine two-horse balisters,"
who are to be paid 10<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> per day (the whole ten).
The usual pay at this time was: to the cross-bowman
with two horses, 15<i>d.</i> per diem; with one horse, 7&frac12;<i>d.</i> per
day; and to the foot-balister, 3<i>d.</i> per day.</p>

<p>The quarrels for the crossbows were carried after the
army in carts. Thus Guillaume Guiart:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Arbaletriers vont quarriaux prendre,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A pointes agues et netes,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Qui la furent <i>en trois charrettes</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1">Venues par mesire Oudart."&mdash;<i>AnnÃ©e</i> 1303, p. 291.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The bows themselves, with other weapons and defences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
were also carted after the host, and termed the "artillery"
of the expedition:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Artillerie est le charroi<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Qui par duc, par comte ou par roi<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Est charchiÃ© (chargÃ©) de quarriaux en guerre,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">D'arbaletes, de dars, de lances,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Et de targes d'une semblance."&mdash;<i>Guiart</i>, an. 1304.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Notwithstanding the services rendered in the front of
the battle by the cross-bowmen, and the other foot-troops;
whose post was the more perilous from their being but
slightly provided with defensive equipment; the knightly
body of their own party made no scruple to ride them
down whenever they stood in the way of the glory or
ambition of the equestrian order. At Courtray in 1302,
the French foot having gallantly repulsed the Flemings,
Messire de Valepayelle cried to the Count of Artois,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sire, cil vilain tant feront<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Que l'onneur en emporteront."&mdash;<i>Guiart</i>, pt. ii. v. 6132.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And forthwith the men-at-arms</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Parmi les pietons se flatissent,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Qu'a force de destriers entr'ouvrent:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Des leurs meismes le champ queuvrent,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Et merveilleux nombre en estraignent."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This is confirmed by the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i>: "Nos gens
de pie savancent, si auront la victoire et nous ny aurons
point d'onneur<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>." All our readers will remember the
similar fate of the Genoese cross-bowmen at Cressy: "Or
tÃ´t, tuez toute cette ribaudaille, qui nous empÃªche la voie
sans raison<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>The arbalester sometimes appears in heavy armour,
as in our woodcuts, Nos. <a href="#i_228.jpg">49</a> and <a href="#i_232.jpg">50</a>. And Matthew Paris
has: "Arcubalistarii circiter sexaginta loricati<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>." The
provision of quarrels for each cross-bowman of the communal
force was fifty, as we learn from the charter of
Theobald, count of Champagne in 1220: "Chascuns de
la Commune de VitrÃ© qui aura vaillant <span class="smcap">xx</span>. livres, aura
aubeleste en son ostel et quarriaux <span class="smcap">l</span>." The office of
"Master of the Arbalesters" became one of the chief
dignities of the French army, and was conferred only on
persons of the highest rank. Thibaut de Monleart held
this charge under Saint Louis, and in the <i>Milice FranÃ§oise</i>
of PÃ¨re Daniel will be found a complete list of the
"MaÃ®tres des ArbalÃªtriers de France" till the days of
Francis I., when the office ceased<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>. The little window
in city or castle wall, through which the bolts of the
crossbow were discharged, was called <i>arbalestena</i>. For
other pictures of the cross-bowman of the thirteenth century
than those given in our woodcuts, Nos. <a href="#i_228.jpg">49</a> and <a href="#i_232.jpg">50</a>,
see Add. MS. 15,268, fol. 122, and Roy. MS. 20, D. 1,
fol. 361<sup>b</sup>.</p>

<p>The Coustiller, employed, as we have seen, at Bovines
in 1214, continues in request throughout this century;
and will be found again in the pages of Froissart, taking
part in the battles of the succeeding age.</p>

<p>The Slinger is still of occasional occurrence. In this
very curious group from Harl. MS. 4751, fol. 8, a work
of the early part of the thirteenth century, the slinger
appears without any defensive armour, and his weapon
differs in no particular from the sling of Anglo-Saxon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a><br /><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
times, as shewn in our woodcut, No. <a href="#i_086.jpg">12</a>. Besides the
ancient Cord Sling, there appears in the manuscripts of
this century a variety of the arm, the Staff Sling. It
seems to have been in vogue for naval warfare, or in
the conflicts of siege operations. The example here
engraved is from Strutt's Horda, vol. i. plate 31; the
authority being a MS. of Matthew Paris of this century,
preserved in the library of Benet College, Cambridge.
Other examples of the Staff Sling are given in Strutt's
Sports, bk. i. chap. 2.</p>

<p>The Bideaux (<i>bibaldi</i>) were foot-troops fighting without
defensive armour, whose usual weapons were a spear,
javelins and a coutel. Guiart exactly describes them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"De Navarre et devers Espaingne<br /></span>

<span class="i1">D'autres armures n'ont cure."&mdash;<i>Pt.</i> ii. <i>verse</i> 10,518.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Ribaux or Brigans were the humblest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
troops, and by their extreme poverty were driven to acts
of depredation which eventually made their very name
synonymous with marauder. They carried such weapons
as they could obtain:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<p>They are not only without armour, but their equipment
altogether is in a very tattered condition:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Et Ribaldorum nihilominus agmen inerme,<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>Matthew Paris names them with but little honour:
"Ribaldi et viles personÃ¦<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>." They were, however, by
no means useless members of the host. Thus, when
Philippe Auguste appeared before Tours in 1189: "Dum
Rex circumquaque immunita civitatis consideraret, Ribaldi
ipsius, <i>qui primos impetus in expugnandis munitionibus
facere consueverunt</i>, eo vidente, in ipsam civitatem
impetum fecerunt," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>They were made to assist in carrying the baggage of
the army: "Inermes Ribaldos et alios, qui solent sequi
exercitum propter onera deportanda<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>." And, being unprovided
with defensive armour, whenever they obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
any booty, the "soudoyers," who were better equipped
than they, attacked them and appropriated their
prizes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mais li Soudoiers de Biaugiers,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">De ce qu'ils portent les desrobent."&mdash;<i>Guiart</i>, v. 10,826.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The <i>Roi des Ribauds</i> was an officer appointed to restrain
the excesses of the Ribaldi, and is mentioned in many
documents of France from the time of Philip Augustus
to that of Charles VI. At the battle of Bovines in 1214,
Roger de Wafalia is named in the list of prisoners as
falling to the share of the King of the Ribauds: "Rogerus
de Wafalia. Hunc habuit Rex Ribaldorum, quia
dicebat se esse servientem."</p>

<p>The names Clientes and Satellites were employed, as
we have before mentioned, to indicate generally the inferior
troops, whether horse or foot. At the battle of
Bovines, the Clientes are a mounted corps, armed with
sword and spear:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">"&mdash;&mdash;Et quos Medardicus abbas<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Quilibet altus equo gladioque horrebat et hastÃ¢."<br /></span>
<span class="i42"><i>Guil. le Breton.</i><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the following passage, the Clientes seem to be foot-troops.
It is from the History of Dauphiny, where, in
1283, Humbert promises to assist the Archbishop and
Chapter of Vienne: "contra omnes homines, suis propriis
sumptibus et expensis, cum centum hominibus armatis
in equis, et cum tercentis balistariis, et septingentis
clientibus cum lanceis."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>
<p>Satellites appear at Bovines, both mounted and on
foot. The horse seem to have formed a light corps, and
were employed to begin the combat. They are looked
upon, however, with much contempt by the opponent
<i>knights</i>; who, disdaining to advance against an ignoble
foe, receive the charge without quitting their post. "PrÃ¦misit,"
says Rigord, "idem Electus<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>, de consilio Comitis
S. Pauli, <span class="smcap">cl</span>. Satellites in equis ad inchoandum bellum,
ea intentione ut prÃ¦dicti milites egregii invenerint hostes
aliquantulum motos et turbatos. Indignati sunt Flandrenses
... quod non a Militibus sed a Satellibus primo
invadebantur: nec se moverent de loco quo stabant, sed
eos ibidem expectantes acriter receperunt," &amp;c. These
troops, we are told, were from the valley of Soissons, and
combated both on foot and on horseback. "Erant Satellites
illi probissimi, de valle Suessionensi, nec minus
pugnabant sine equis quam in equis."</p>

<p>Not only were Spies in use, but, what somewhat disturbs
one's confidence in the exalted simplicity of these
times, it had already been discovered that the fair sex
might be employed with advantage in this office. The
heroic Edward I., in his campaign against the Welsh in
1281, gives a shilling to a "certain female spy" for her
services: "Cuidam spiatrici, de dono, xij. denarii<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>." And
again, a pound to another of these useful ladies, "to buy
her a house:" "Cuidam spiatrici, ad unam domum sibi
emendam, de dono, xx. s.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>"</p>

<p>From the various Statutes of Arms of this century we
learn very exactly the equipment of the military tenants.
Three of these statutes for England have been preserved:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
that of 1252, in the Additamenta of the Historia Major
of Matthew Paris, and printed in Rymer's F&#339;dera; that
forming part of the Statute of Winchester in 1285,
printed by the Record Commission in vol. i. of the "Statutes
of the Realm;" and that of 1298, printed in the
new edition of the F&#339;dera, vol. i. p. 901. The Scottish
enactments will be found in Skene's <i>Regiam Majestatem</i>,
and the French in the <i>Collection des Ordonnances</i>.</p>

<p>The Assize of 1252, 36 of Hen. III., closely resembles
that of 1285; but in the first the equipment is of six
varieties, while in the second there are seven classes of
armed men. To avoid repetition, we shall give the
earliest of these statutes in the text, and add the readings
relating to the armour from the Statute of Winchester
in a note.</p>

<p>The Sheriffs, with two knights elected for that purpose,
are to go round the hundreds, cities, &amp;c., and call
before them the "cives, burgenses, liberÃ¨ tenentes, villanos

<p>The distinction between the kinds of arrow to be used
within and without the forest bounds, is curious, and not
altogether clear at this distance from the days of archery.
The fatal power of the barbed shaft upon the king's deer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
is indeed evident enough, but the comparatively innocuous
character of the piled arrow is not so plain. The
usage, however, is well attested by numerous instances.
In the Statute of arms of William the Lion, king of Scotland,
we have: "Et omnes alii, qui habere poterunt, habeant
arcum et sagittas extra forestam: infra forestam,
arcum et pyle<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>." And by an agreement made in 1246
between Roger de Quinci, earl of Winchester, and Roger
de Somery, touching certain rights of chace in Bradgate
Park, co. Leicester, it is stipulated "quod Forestarii sui
non portabunt in bosco prÃ¦dicti Rogeri de Somery et
hÃ¦redum suorum sagittas barbatas sed pilettas<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>."</p>

<p>Shakespere, who illustrates everything, has a passage
bearing on this subject among the rest. Under the
greenwood tree of the forest of Arden, the Duke, in "As
you like it," addresses his companions:&mdash;</p>

<p>The feudal levy of the Ban and ArriÃ¨re-ban was of
course much influenced by the pressure of the occasion
requiring their armament. In 1205 King John, in a
Council held at Winchester, called upon every tenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
knight in the realm to accompany him into Poitou, at
the expense of the other nine; and if, during his absence,
the country should be invaded, every man capable
of bearing arms was to join in its defence, under pain of
forfeiting any lands he might hold; or, if not a landowner,
of becoming, with all his posterity, a <i>slave</i> for
ever, and paying a yearly poll-tax of four-pence. Each
knight was to receive two shillings per day<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>. This expedition
did not, however, leave our shores.</p>

<p>When Philip of France was preparing to attack King
John in 1213, the English monarch summoned all his
"liberos homines et servientes, vel quicunque sint," to
aid him under pain of culvertage<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>.</p>

<p>In 1264, when the Earl of Leicester mustered his
forces on Barham Downs to resist the threatened invasion
of Queen Eleanor, the military tenants were ordered,
under pain of felony, to bring into the field not only the
force specified in their tenures, but all the horsemen and
infantry in their power: every township was compelled
to send eight, six, or four footmen well armed with
lances, bows, swords, cross-bows, and axes, who should
serve forty days at the expense of the township; and the
cities and burghs received orders to furnish as many
horsemen and footmen as the Sheriff should appoint<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>.</p>

<p>The Pay assigned to troops who, having contributed
the stipulated service for their holdings or assessments,
were required to render further assistance to the king in
his wars, we discover in the Roll of Expenses of King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>

<p>Of the Armed Town-Watch in England we obtain
some particulars from the "Breve Regis" of the 36th
Hen. III. "Henry, king, &amp;c. to such or such a sheriff,
greeting. Be it known to you that, for the maintenance
of our peace, it has been provided in our Council, that
watch shall be kept in every city, borough and town of
your county, from Ascension Day to the Feast of St.
Michael; to wit: that in every city, six armed men
(<i>armis munitos</i>) shall watch at every gate: in every
borough, twelve men: in every town (<i>in singulis villis
integris</i>) six men, or at least four, likewise furnished
with arms, according to the number of the inhabitants.
They shall watch continually throughout the night from
sunset to sunrise; so that all strangers seeking to pass
through, may be detained till morning. And then, if he
be a loyal man (<i>fidelis</i>), he shall be set at liberty; if a
suspected person (<i>suspectus</i>), he shall be delivered over
to the Sheriff, to be by him kept in a place of safety.
But if it happen that strangers of this latter sort refuse
to allow themselves to be stopped, then the aforesaid
Guards shall raise the hue against them on all sides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
and shall follow them with all the inhabitants of the
place (<i>cum tota villata</i>) and places adjacent, raising the
hue and cry 'de villa in villam' until they be taken<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>," &amp;c.
The manner of the hue and cry is set down in the "Articuli<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>."
"Pursuit by hue and cry to be made according
to the ancient and proper form, so that those who neglect
to follow the cry may be taken as accomplices of the evil-doers,
and delivered to the Sheriff. Moreover, in every
town, four or six men, according to the number of the
inhabitants, shall be appointed to make the hue and cry
with promptitude and perseverance, and to pursue evil-doers,
if any should appear, with bows and arrows and
other light weapons (<i>et aliis levibus armis</i>); which
weapons ought to be provided for the custody of the
whole town, and to remain for the use of the aforesaid
town. And besides the foregoing, there shall be provided
out of each hundred, two free and loyal men of most influence,
to be over them, and to see that the watch be
duly made, as well as the pursuits aforesaid."</p>

Paris, contained in an ordinance of Saint Louis in 1254;

<p>The feudal constitution of armies was necessarily
modified in different countries by the nature of the territory,
the habits of the people, and the wealth of the
state. In Germany, where the class of nobles was more
restricted than in France and England, the foot-troops
were at an early period regarded with consideration. In
hilly countries, where the breed of horses was of a small
stature, a light-armed cavalry was the most available<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
force. While, in the fastnesses of mountains, the pikes
and halberds of a sturdy infantry compensated for the
want of horses and the poverty of a rugged territory.</p>

<p>The Scottish army in 1244, Matthew Paris<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> tells us,
was "very numerous and powerful, consisting of a
thousand armed knights, well mounted, although not on
Spanish or Italian, or other costly horses, and well protected
by armour of steel or linen; and about a hundred
thousand foot-soldiers, who were all of one mind, and
who, having made confession, and been encouraged by
the consoling assurance of their preachers, that the cause
in which they were engaged was a just one and for their
country's good, had very little fear of death." In 1298
Wallace contending against Edward I. in person, formed
his pikemen, who were the strength of his army, into
four circular bodies<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>, connected together by a number
of archers from the Forest of Selkirk. Before them he
planted a defence of palisades: behind them, the cavalry
was stationed. In front of all was a morass, dividing
them from the English. The latter, having passed the
night on the bare heath, in the morning advanced to
the attack. Their first division, commanded by the Earl
Marshal, from its ignorance of the ground, soon became
entangled in the morass. The second, led by the Bishop
of Durham, wheeled round the swamp and came in sight
of the Scottish cavalry, when the prelate ordered his men
to await the arrival of the other bodies. "To thy mass,
bishop!" exclaimed one of his knights, and rushed on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
enemy. They gave way at the first charge; the bowmen
were trampled under foot, but the four bodies of pikemen
opposed on all sides an impenetrable front. The bravest
resistance, however, could not restore the fortune of the
day. Edward advanced his archers, supporting them
with his military engines, an opening was made in each
circle, the men-at-arms dashed in among the disordered
pikemen, and the battle was won<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>. This conflict, fought
near Falkirk, on the 22nd of July, 1298, affords one of
innumerable instances, shewing that little reliance can
be placed in the numbers of the slain given by even cotemporary
writers. Trivet reports the loss of the Scotch
at twenty thousand; Matthew of Westminster raises it
to forty thousand.</p>

<p>The Welsh, keeping up their hostilities to their Norman
invaders, reserved their aggressive operations till
the wet and stormy season of the year, when the land
was unfit for the man&#339;uvres of a heavy-armed cavalry,
and the gloomy days favourable for the sudden onslaught
of mountain warriors. "Videntes tempus hyemale madidum
sibi competere," says Matthew Paris<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>.</p>

<p>The rich cities of Italy, as we have seen, began about
the middle of this century to employ stipendiary men-at-arms;
and it seems probable that the first of these
knightly soldiers were those of the equestrian class who,
from political disgust or family feuds, had become refugees
in the territory of their new masters. The good
wages and the booty obtained by these gentle mercenaries
induced others of a more humble class to
take up the trade, and under skilful leaders (the well-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
Condottieri) they obtained fame, fortune and
honours.</p>

<p>The Basques were at this time among the most prominent
of the mercenary troops, acting as a light corps, for
which their mountain-life rendered them very apt. They
were the Swiss of the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>Among our northern neighbours we obtain a glimpse of
the Frieslanders, through the means of the indefatigable
Matthew Paris. "These Frieslanders," he says, "are
a rude and untamable people: they inhabit a northern
country, are well skilled in naval warfare, and fight with
great vigour and courage on the ice. It is of the cold regions
of these people, and their neighbours the Sarmatians,
that Juvenal says, 'One had better fly hence, beyond the
Sarmatians and the icy ocean,' &amp;c. The Frieslanders,
therefore, having laid ambuscades among the rush-beds
along the sea-coast, (in their war with William of Holland,)
as well as along the country, which is marshy&mdash;and
the winter season was coming on&mdash;went in pursuit of the
said William, armed with javelins, which they call <i>gaveloches</i>,
in the use of which they are very expert, and with
Danish axes and pikes, and clad in linen dresses covered
with light armour. On reaching a certain marsh they
met with William, helmeted, and wearing armour, and
mounted on a large war-horse covered with mail. But,
as he rode along, the ice broke, although it was more
than half a foot thick, and the horse sank up to his flank,
becoming fixed in the mud of the marsh. The trammelled
rider dug his sharp spurs into the animal's sides
to a great depth, and the noble, fiery beast struggled to
rise and free himself, but without success. Crushed and
bruised, he only sank the deeper for his efforts, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
length by his struggles he threw his rider among the
rough slippery fragments of ice. The Frieslanders then
rushed on William, who had no one to help him from his
position, all his companions having fled, to avoid a similar
disaster; and attacking him on all sides with their
javelins, despite his cries for mercy, pierced his body
through and through, which was already stiffened with
wet and cold. He offered his murderers an immense
sum of money for ransom of his life, but these inhuman
men, shewing no mercy, cut him to pieces. And thus,
just as he had a taste of empire, was the Flower of Chivalry,
William, king of Germany and count of Holland,
the creature and pupil of the Pope, hurled, at the will of
his enemies, from the pinnacle of his high dignity to the
depths of confusion and ruin<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>."</p>

<p>Clerics are still found participating the dangers and
glories of the battle-field; not alone as councillors or
leaders, but sturdily wielding the deadly mace, and clad
in hauberk and helm, like the lay vassals and men-at-arms
around them. We have already seen the Bishop
of Durham leading a division of the English at the battle
of Falkirk. At the great battle of Bovines, in 1214, the
French army was commanded by Guerin, bishop-elect of
Senlis; and there too, armed to the teeth, and plying the
cleric weapon, the mace, contended that bishop of Beauvais,
whom we have, on a former occasion, seen the prisoner
of Richard C&#339;ur-de-Lion. At the siege of Milan, in
1238, "the bishop-elect of Valentia, who knew more of
temporal than spiritual arms, hastened with the knights
whom the counts of Toulouse and Provence had sent to assist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
the emperor<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>." In 1239 the Emperor Frederic, writing
to the king of England, complains of the Pope becoming
a general and his monks men-at-arms, to wrest from him
his crown of empire. "He hath openly declared himself
the leader and chief of the war against us and the empire,
making the cause of the Milanese and other faithless
traitors his own, and openly turning their business
to suit his own interests. Moreover, he appointed as
his lieutenants over the Milanese, or rather the papal,
army, the before-mentioned Gregory de Monte Longo
and brother Leo, a minister of the Minorite order, who
not only girded on the sword and clad themselves in armour,
presenting the false appearance of soldiers; but
also, continuing their office of preaching, absolved from
their sins the Milanese and others, when they insulted
our person or those of our followers<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>." Father John of
Gatesden boldly throws aside alb and chasuble to don
the knightly hauberk and chausses in good earnest.
"Anno Domini 1245, King Henry passed Christmas at
London, and observed the solemnities of that festival in
the company of many of his nobles. At that place, on
Christmas-day, he conferred the honour of knighthood
on John de Gatesden, a clerk, who had enjoyed several
rich benefices; but who, as was proper, now resigned
them all<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>." In the contest for the empire in 1248, the
army raised against Conrad by the legate, "was commanded
by the archbishops of Mayence, Metz, Lorraine
and Strasburg, and consisted of innumerable bands from

part of the papal tactics to invest the soldiers who fought
in the quarrels of the Holy See with the sacred dignity
of Crusaders. In the revolt of the Scots under Bruce in
1306, among the prisoners captured by the English were
the Abbot of Scone and the Bishops of St. Andrew's and
Glasgow, all taken in complete armour<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>.</p>

<p>The leading principle in the <span class="smcap">Tactics</span> of this century
was, with the exceptions already noticed, to compose the
<i>strength of the army</i> of the knightly order. It was the
knight who fought in the terrible mÃªlÃ©e of the battle-field:
it was the knight who scaled the walls of the besieged
fortress; who directed the discharge of perrier
and mangonel; who filled the towers of assault by the
city walls; who defended those walls from outward attack;
and who, in sea-fights, manned the ships of war,
and with pike and javelin contended against other men-at-arms
battling in the adverse fleet. The remainder of
the troops were looked upon as mere accessories, engines
useful to clear the way for the "achievement" of the
equestrian order.</p>

<p>The men-at-arms marched to the field of battle in
squadrons so dense that, as a cotemporary writer records,
"a glove thrown into the midst of them would not have
reached the ground."</p>

<p>They charged, however, in single line&mdash;<i>en haie</i>&mdash;the onset
of the first rank being supported by the successive charges
of those behind. The ancient formation of the wedge
(<i>cuneus</i>) was not, however, altogether abandoned, whether
for horse or foot. The particular manner in which the
German cavalry composed the wedge, beginning with a
front of seven men, and increasing each rank by one additional
soldier, as far as to half the depth of the formation,
is very clearly shewn by Fronsperger<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>. "Wie

adopted a similar formation in acting against the French.
"Les FranÃ§ois virent une trÃ¨s grande bataille des Flamands,

<p>The entire army was usually formed into three "battles:"
sometimes into four; and occasionally the whole
force was gathered into one body. In 1249 the Imperialists,
fighting against the Bolognese, distributed
their troops into three corps, while the latter formed
four<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>. And in 1266, Manfred, in a battle with Charles
d'Anjou, ranged his cavalry in three bodies, while his
adversary divided his army into four parts<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>.</p>

<p>In front of all were placed the various "gyns" of the
host; the mangonels, trebuchets, perdriaux, &amp;c., serving
in some degree the purpose of gunnery in our own day.</p>

<p>The Archers and Cross-bowmen were usually placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
at the wings, the infantry of the communal levy in the
centre, and behind these the mounted men-at-arms.</p>

<p>Archers were sometimes intermixed with the cavalry.
Thus, in the 23rd of Edward I., the Earl of Warwick
fighting against the Welsh, the latter "placed their men-at-arms
fronting the earl's army: they were furnished
with very long spears, which, being set on the ground,
had their points suddenly turned towards the earl and
his company, in order to break the force of the English
cavalry. But the earl had well provided against them;
for between every two horsemen he had placed an archer,
so that, by their missile weapons, those who held the
lances were put to the rout<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>." We have already seen
<i>bodies</i> of archers interspersed with other troops in the
conflict between Edward and Wallace in 1298<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>.</p>

<p>To defend themselves from the attack of cavalry, the
army occasionally formed a barrier of carts and wagons.</p>

<p>The more usual entrenchment was the ancient one of a
ditch and palissaded bank.</p>

<p>Stratagems were still greatly in vogue, and some of
them are of so dramatic a character that they tell rather
of the jongleur than of the sober historian. Others, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
enough of the marvellous, are less out of the bounds of
probability. In 1250, Matthew Paris informs us, the
Saracens gained a victory over a body of Crusaders,
whom they slew. Desiring to obtain possession of Damietta,
which was in the hands of the Christians, "a
strong body of them, about equal in number to the Crusaders
they had slain, treacherously putting on the armour,
and carrying the shields and standards of the
Christians who had fallen, set out thus disguised towards
Damietta; in order that, having the appearance of French
troops, they might gain admission into the city, and, as
soon as admitted, might kill all they found therein. When
they approached the walls, the Christians on guard looked
forth from the ramparts and towers, and at first thought
they were Christians, exultingly bearing spoils and trophies:
but the nearer they approached, the more unlike
Frenchmen they seemed: for they marched hurriedly
and in disordered crowds, and sloped their shields irregularly,
more after the manner of Saracens than of French.
And when they reached the extremities of the fortifications
and approached the gates of the city, they were
clearly seen to be Saracens by their black and bearded
faces. But who can fully relate the heartfelt grief of the
Christians when they saw the enemies of the faith giving
vent to their pride and derision, clad in the armour, and
bearing the standards and painted devices which were so
well known to them<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>."</p>

<p>The device of equipping several soldiers in similar
arms to the leader of the host, seems also to have been in
use. At the siege of Viterbo in 1243, Matthew Paris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
tells us, "One illustrious soldier on the Emperor's side,
and adorned with his special arms, (<i>armis ipsius specialibus
decoratus</i>,) miserably expired, to the great grief of
the Emperor, being pierced by the quarrel of a crossbow.
His enemies raised a shout of joy, thinking they
had slain the Emperor himself; but the Emperor, preceded
by his trumpeters, advanced; and, though not
without difficulty, disengaged his army from the fury of
their opponents, who had suddenly pressed forward to
crush them<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>."</p>

<p>The influence of the stars, the power of lucky and
unlucky days over the issue of battle, were still occasionally
acknowledged; not alone by the rude leaders
of a company of men-at-arms, but by the commanders
of armies, by crowned dignitaries. The Emperor Frederic
II. had a firm faith in the predictions of astrologers;
he never undertook a march until the fortunate
moment for departure had been fixed by those skilled
in divination; and when, in 1239, he was about to
advance against Treviso, his march was suddenly arrested
by an eclipse of the sun<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>.</p>

<p>The usual <span class="smcap">Body-armour</span> of the knightly order was, in
the early part of the thirteenth century, of interlinked
chain-mail; but, in the second half of the century, portions
of plate appear, in the form of shoulder-pieces, elbow-pieces,
and knee-pieces. The chain-mail was of hammered
iron, the art of wire-drawing not being found till about the
middle of the next age. Other materials were occasionally
employed for defensive purposes: leather, quilting,
scale and jazerant-work, and, at the close of the century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
a kind of armour which has been named Banded-mail,
but of which the structure has not been exactly ascertained.
There can be little doubt that, among the more
humble troops, the Coustillers and the Ribauds, every
kind of defensive material was in use which these men
could obtain: a pectoral and a helmet of some sort were
almost indispensable, to protect them from the downward
flight of the arrows, which played so principal a part,
whether in the field or the siege. The knights themselves,
indeed, did not attempt a uniform costume: on
the contrary, it is often made a reproach to them, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
each endeavoured to outvie the other in the magnificence
of his apparel. On rare occasions we find a band of
cavaliers who exhibit the marvel of a similar equipment.
When Richard, earl of Gloucester, visited the Pope, in
1250, "he travelled through the kingdom of France
accompanied by the Countess, his wife, and his eldest
son, Henry, with a numerous suite, and attended by a
large retinue, in great pomp, consisting of forty knights
equipped in new accoutrements, all alike, and mounted
on beautiful horses, bearing new harness, glittering with
gold, and with five wagons and fifty sumpter-horses; so
that he presented a wonderful and honourable show to
the sight of the astonished French beholders<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>."</p>

<p>The usual series of knightly garments was the tunic,
the gambeson, the hauberk, the chausses, the chausson,
and the surcoat. With these are found various accessories:
the ailettes, coudiÃ¨res, poleyns, and greaves.</p>

<p>The Tunic has already been seen in the first seal of
Richard I., and other monuments. It again appears in
this curious group, part of a martyrdom of Thomas Ã 
Becket, from Harl. MS. 5102, fol. 32, a work of the beginning
of the thirteenth century (<i>overleaf</i>.) It is found
also in our woodcut No. <a href="#i_284.jpg">63</a>, from Add. MS. 17,687, an
example of the close of the century.</p>

<p>The Gambeson, that quilted garment which we have
seen was worn as an additional defence beneath the hauberk
of chain-mail, is in view in the monumental effigy
from Haseley church, Oxfordshire, (woodcut <a href="#i_219.jpg">46</a>,) a figure
seemingly of the middle of this century. It is again very
clearly shewn in our woodcut No. <a href="#i_274.jpg">59</a>, an effigy in Ash
church, near Sandwich. In both these examples the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
vertical lines of quilting are plainly expressed by the
sculptor. Ducange, in his Observations on the History
of St. Louis, cites an account of the year 1268, which
includes "ExpensÃ¦ pro cendatis et bourra ad Gambesones<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>."
These might, however, have been the Gambesons
that formed of themselves the body-armour of the
soldier. It is very clearly distinguished as a horseman's
garment in a passage of the Statutes of Frejus, in 1235;
where also we see the gambeson <i>alone</i> accorded to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a><br /><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a><br /><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
foot-fighter: "Militem sine equo armato intelligimus
armatum auspergoto et propuncto (with hauberk and
gambeson) et scuto: peditem armatum intelligimus armatum
scuto et propuncto <i>seu</i> aspergoto." The Chronicon
Colmariense, under the year 1298, is still more
explicit: "Armati reputabantur qui galeas ferreas in
capitibus habebant, et qui wambasia, id est, tunicam
spissam ex lino et stuppa, vel veteribus pannis consutam,
et <i>desuper</i> camisiam ferream."</p>

<p>The Hauberk of chain-mail, in the beginning of the
thirteenth century, was made with continuous coif and
gloves, the coif somewhat flattened at the top of the
head, and the gloves not divided into fingers; it descended
nearly to the knees, and at the face-opening left
little more than the eyes and nose of the knight in view.
A striking example of the last-named arrangement is afforded
by the figure here engraved, the sculptured effigy
of William LongespÃ©e, at Salisbury, c. 1227. See also the
seal of King John, p. <a href="#Page_228">228</a>, and the woodcut, No. <a href="#i_257.jpg">53</a>, from
Harl. MS. 5102. The sleeve of the hauberk is sometimes
secured at the wrist by a lace or strap; as in the figure
of LongespÃ©e, in the brass of Sir Roger de Trumpington,
c. 1289, (woodcut <a href="#i_312.jpg">73</a>,) and the effigy at Norton, Durham,
of the end of the century (woodcut <a href="#i_302.jpg">70</a>). In order to
liberate the hand occasionally from its fingerless glove,
an aperture was left in the centre of the palm. This is
clearly shewn in our woodcuts, No. <a href="#i_330.jpg">80</a> and <a href="#i_281.jpg">62</a>; the first
from the Lives of the Offas, Cotton MS., Nero, D. i.;
and the other from Roy. MS. 2, A. <span class="smcap">xxii</span>. The glove
turned off and hanging from the wrist may be seen in
Plate 17 of Hefner's <i>Trachten</i>, and in the sculptured
effigy of a knight in Bingham church, Nottinghamshire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
In the second half of the century the gloves of the
hauberk were divided for the fingers; from which we
may suppose that the armour-smith had by this time
improved his art by making his mail-web more flexible
and more delicate. Early examples occur in the sculptured
effigies of knights at Rampton, Cambridgeshire,
and Danbury, Essex; the former figured in Stothard's
Monuments, Plate 20; the latter in Strutt's Dress and
Habits, Plates 45 and 46. Instances both of the undivided
and the fingered glove will be found among our
engravings. Occasionally the sleeves of the hauberk
terminate at the wrist, as those of the archers in cuts <a href="#i_222.jpg">47</a>
and <a href="#i_226.jpg">48</a>; in these instances obviously for the greater
freedom in handling the bow. Where the lancer's hauberk
is thus fashioned, the hand has the supplementary
defence of a gauntlet. Gauntlets of scalework occur in
a knightly brass, c. 1280, engraved by Waller, Part x.,
and Boutell<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>, p. 113. To the elbows of the hauberk
were sometimes affixed, but rarely in this century,
plates of metal called <i>coudiÃ¨res</i>. An effigy in Salisbury
Cathedral, circa 1260, (Stothard, Pl. <span class="smcap">xxx</span>.,) offers a good
example. There is another, a knight of the Clinton
family, in the church of Coleshill, Warwickshire. The
hauberk was subject to a further variety: it was made
with or without a <i>Collar</i>. Matthew Paris tells us that
in a hastilude "at the abbey of Wallenden" in 1252,
the lance of Roger de Lemburn entered beneath the
helm of his antagonist and pierced his throat, for he was
uncovered in that part of his body, and without a collar
(<i>carens collario</i>). Ducange cites an analogous passage:
"Venitque ictus inter cassidem et collarium, dejecitque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
caput ejus multum a corpore<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>." The hauberk without
collar may be seen in the figures of <i>Largesse</i> and <i>DebonnairetÃ©</i>
in the pictures of the Painted Chamber (Vet.
Mon., vol. vi.)</p>

<p>The Continuous Coif was in the early part of the century
nearly flat at the top; in the second half the round-topped
coif was more usual. The flattened form is well
shewn in the statue of LongespÃ©e (woodcut, No. <a href="#i_259.jpg">54</a>), and
in those of De l'Isle and De Braci, (Stothard, Plates <span class="smcap">xix</span>.
and <span class="smcap">xx</span>.) The rounded crown occurs frequently in our
woodcuts. The coif was drawn over the head by means
of an opening in the side, and was then fastened by a
lace, a buckle, or a tie. The manner in which the lace,
passing through alternate groups of the links farming the
coif, is made to secure the loose to the fixed part of the
cap, is excellently shewn in the figures of LongespÃ©e and
the so-called Duke of Normandy in Gloucester Cathedral,
(Stothard, Plate <span class="smcap">xxii</span>.) A good example of the fastening
by strap and buckle is furnished by the fragment of an
effigy found at Exeter, engraved in the ArchÃ¦ological
Journal, vol. ix. p. 188. The coif adjusted by a tie is
seen in our woodcut, No. <a href="#i_281.jpg">62</a>. The side-piece hanging
free is shewn in a knightly statue of this century in the
Abbey Church of Pershore, Worcestershire, engraved in
the Journal of the ArchÃ¦ological Association, vol. iv.
p. 319. The coif is sometimes encircled by a fillet. See
our woodcuts, No. <a href="#i_219.jpg">46</a>, <a href="#i_274.jpg">59</a>, and <a href="#i_284.jpg">63</a>. The circles are of
gold-colour in figures of the Painted Chamber (Pl. <span class="smcap">xxx</span>.):
in the effigy of William de Valence the band is richly
jewelled, (Stothard, Pl. <span class="smcap">xliv</span>.)</p>

<p>Many examples shew that the warrior often went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
battle without any kind of helmet <i>over</i> the coif of chain-mail;
though it is probable that some additional defence,
whether of plate or of quilted-work, was in this case worn
beneath it. The regular and compact form of the crown
in many ancient examples favours this belief; and a
modern instance from the East helps to confirm it. A
suit of Birman armour in the Tower of London has a
skull-cap of plate which is quite hidden from view by
the outer armour of the head. In the effigy at Bingham,
Notts., already mentioned, the upper part of the coif is
so large that it almost gives the notion of a turban being
worn beneath. The coif used in battle without any further
defence over it, may be seen in our engravings,
No. <a href="#i_330.jpg">80</a> and <a href="#i_340.jpg">82</a>.</p>

<p>On other occasions, the mail-coif had the additional
armament of a helmet of some kind. This may be better
considered in our general notice of helmets.</p>

<p>The Hood of Chain-mail appears to have been designed
as an improvement on the Continuous Coif by rendering
unnecessary the side-opening and the lacing about the
face. But the hood had this great disadvantage; that,
as it lay on the shoulders of the knight, it permitted the
lance of the adversary to pass beneath it and deal a
deadly thrust on the unguarded neck. This fact is of
constant occurrence, as well in the chronicles as in the
pictures of the times. The hood, like the coif, is both
flat-topped and round. The flattened hood is seen in the
effigy of De l'Isle, (Stothard, Pl. <span class="smcap">xx</span>.) The round appears
in the brasses of Sir John D'Aubernoun (woodcut, No. <a href="#i_264.jpg">55</a>),
and Sir Roger de Trumpington (Waller, Pt. iv., and our
woodcut, No. <a href="#i_312.jpg">73</a>): in the statues of De Vere, Crouchback,
and Shurland, figured by Stothard; and in our engravings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
No. <a href="#i_274.jpg">59</a> and <a href="#i_284.jpg">63</a>. A simple lace, passing across
the forehead and tying
behind, bound the hood
firmly to the head. The
manner of this may be
seen on comparing the
brass of Sir John D'Aubernoun
and the statue of
Sir Robert Shurland. Both
hood and coif appear occasionally
to have been slipped
over the head and suffered
to rest on the shoulders.
Compare the effigy
in the Temple Church
(Stothard, Pl. <span class="smcap">xxxviii</span>.),
Hefner's plate 27, and
our woodcuts No. <a href="#i_265.jpg">56</a> and
<a href="#i_302.jpg">70</a>. The hood is sometimes
shewn as made of a
cloth-like material, (cloth,
leather, or pourpointerie?)
as in the front figure of
our engraving, No. <a href="#i_295.jpg">68</a>,
from a MS. in the library
of Metz. Its colour is
brown, while the banded
mail in this drawing is
iron-colour. (Hefner, Pl.
<span class="smcap">lxxvii</span>.) Plain and enriched
fillets, which we
have seen were worn over
the mail-coif, appear also upon the hood. The plain circle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
occurs in the Gosberton effigy (Stothard, Pl. <span class="smcap">xxxvii</span>.),
and in our woodcuts, No. <a href="#i_274.jpg">59</a> and <a href="#i_284.jpg">63</a>. Enriched examples
are found in the sculptures of De Vere and Crouchback
(Stothard, Pl. <span class="smcap">xxxvi</span>. and <span class="smcap">xlii</span>.).</p>

<p>Beneath the head-defence of chain-mail was worn a
coif of softer material, to mitigate the roughness of the
iron-cloth; and perhaps also to assist in protecting the
head by being made of quilted-work. See our woodcut,
No. <a href="#i_265.jpg">56</a>, from a miniature given by Willemin (Monumens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>

<span class="smcap">xxxv</span>., and Willemin, j. Pl. <span class="smcap">cxliii</span>.</p>

<p>Besides the Hauberk already described, which however
forms in a great majority of instances the body-armour
of the knights of this time, we have several
varieties of defensive equipment. The Haubergeon is
still mentioned, and seems to imply, not alone the
smaller hauberk of chain-mail, but sometimes a garment
of inferior defence and different material. There is also
a chain-mail hauberk made with sleeves which reach but
little below the elbows. A good example occurs on folio
9 of Roy. MS. 12, F. xiii.; a Bestiarium. See also the
figures of Virtues in Plates <span class="smcap">xxxviii</span>. and <span class="smcap">xxxix</span>. of the
Painted Chamber.</p>

<p>The Gambeson or Pourpoint, or <i>Gambesiata Lorica</i>, as
it is called in a will of the year 1286, frequently appears
as forming of itself the coat of fence. It is thus noticed
in the Statute of Winchester, already quoted; where,
while the first class of tenants are prescribed a "hauber,
chapel de feer," &amp;c., the third class are to have "parpoint,
chapel de feer, espe e cutel." Compare also the Statute
of Arms of 1252. In the eighth of Edward I. we read
that "Rogerus de Wanstede tenet dimid. serjantiam
ibidem per servitium inveniendi unum Valectum per
octo dies, sumptibus propriis, cum praepuncto, capella
ferrea et lancea, custodire castrum de Portsmut tempore
guerrae<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>." In the "Ordonnances sur le Commerce et
les MÃ©tiers," the duties of the pourpointers of Paris at
the close of this century are very exactly defined. "Se
l'on fait cotes gamboisiees, que elles soient couchees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
deuement sur neufves estoffes, et pointees, enfermees,
faites a deux fois, bien et nettement emplies, de bonnes
estoffes, soient de coton ou dautres estoffes<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>." Again:
"Item que nul doresenavant ne puist faire cote gamboisiee
ou il n'ait trois livres de coton tout net, si elles
ne sont faites en fremes, et au dessous soient faites entremains,
et que il y ait un ply de vieil linge emprez
l'endroit de demie aulne et demy quartier devant et
autant derriere." From these enactments we see that
the counterpointers of the thirteenth century were but
too apt to construct their armours of unstable materials,
and to stuff them with a niggard hand.</p>

<p>The Cuirie (<i>Cuirena</i>) was, as its name implies, originally
a defence of leather: it was also made of cloth.
It covered the body alone, requiring the addition of
<i>BrachiÃ¨res</i> to complete the coat. Thus, in the Roll of
Purchases made for the Windsor tournament in the
sixth year of Edward I., we have: "De Milon&#772;. le Cuireur&#834;
(Milo the Currier) xxxiij. quiret&#834;, p'c pec&#772; iij. <i>s.</i>" Each
took two ells of the cloth called Carda in its construction:
"It&#834; pro qualibet quirett&#834; ij. uln&#772; card." The sleeves appear
to have been of pourpointerie: "It&#834; pro xxxviij. par&#834;
brach&#834;, x. bukerann&#772;<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>."</p>

<p>An account cited by Ducange, of the date 1239, has:&mdash;"Pro
hernesio suo, videlicet baccis et cuireniis suis
affecturis <span class="smcap">ix</span>. lib. v. sol. Item pro tribus baccis et tribus
cuirenis ad eosdem, <span class="smcap">iv</span>. lib. iv. sol." See the glossarists
under <i>Baca</i>. Guiart also mentions the cuirie:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hyaumes, haubers, tacles, cuiries,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Fondent par les grans cops et fraingnent."<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>The Cargan seems to have been a collar or tippet of
chain-mail. It occurs as part of a footman's armour in
the Statutes of Frejus, A.D. 1233: "Peditem armatum
intelligimus armatum scuto et propuncto, seu auspergoto,
et cofa seu capello ferreo, et cargan, vel sine cargan," &amp;c.
The glossarists derive this and the cognate word, <i>carcannum</i>,
from &#954;&#945;&#961;&#954;&#8055;&#957;&#959;&#962;, genus vinculi; and, if this derivation
is the true one, a gorget of chain-mail may be fairly
inferred.</p>

<p>Other materials for armour than those mentioned above
appear during the thirteenth century; but, before noticing
these, it may be well to take a glance at the remaining
<i>parts</i> of the knightly suit as they occur in the usual
monuments of the time; then to examine the appendages
which are attached to the body-armour, as the ailettes;
after which we will notice the exceptional materials employed
for defensive purposes; and lastly, those portions
of the warrior's equipment which have not been included
in the above scheme of investigation.</p>

<p>The Chausses, in the early part of the thirteenth century
were entirely of chain-mail, covering the whole leg;
as shewn in our woodcuts, No. <a href="#i_219.jpg">46</a>, <a href="#i_255.jpg">52</a>, and <a href="#i_259.jpg">54</a>. Sometimes
they were tightened below the knee with a lace,
as in the two Salisbury effigies (Stothard, Plates <span class="smcap">xvii</span>.
and <span class="smcap">xxx</span>., and our woodcut, No. <a href="#i_259.jpg">54</a>.) A variety of this
defence was laid on the front part of the leg, and then
laced up behind. See woodcut, No. <a href="#i_257.jpg">53</a>, from Harl. MS.
5102, fol. 32, a book of the early part of the century;
and our numbers 56 and 62, towards the close of this
period. Compare also Plates <span class="smcap">xxxiii</span>. of Hefner, Plate
<span class="smcap">liv</span>. of Strutt's Horda, and folio 10 of Roy. MS. 12,
F. <span class="smcap">xiii</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>To the chausses, whether of chain-mail or of banded-mail,
are sometimes added Poleyns (or knee-pieces) of
plate. It is often, however, difficult to determine whether
the poleyns are fixed to the chausses or the chausson,
from the upper edge of them being covered by the hauberk.
A good example of the chausses armed with the
knee-piece is offered by the knightly statue in Salisbury
Cathedral (Stothard, Pl. <span class="smcap">xxx</span>.), circa 1260. See also our
woodcuts, No. <a href="#i_317.jpg">75</a> and <a href="#i_323.jpg">77</a>: the first from Add. MS. 11,639,
fol. 520; the latter from a glass-painting in the north
transept of Oxford Cathedral. A German example given
by Hefner (Pt. i. Pl. <span class="smcap">lxxvii</span>.), from a manuscript illuminated
at Metz c. 1280, is copied in our woodcut, No.
<a href="#i_295.jpg">68</a>. Poleyns are named in the Wardrobe Account of
28 Ed. I. (1300): "factura diversorum armorum, vexillorum,
et penocellorum, pro Domino Edwardo filio Regis,
et Johanne de Lancastria, jamberis, poleyns, platis, uno
capello ferri, una cresta cum clavis argenti pro eodem
capello," &amp;c.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the thirteenth century the Chausses
are most commonly accompanied with a Chausson of
leather or quilted-work, the purpose of which was probably
to obviate the inconvenience of the long chausses
of metal in riding. It is found plain, gamboised in vertical
lines, and sometimes richly diapered. The plain
chausson is well shewn in Stothard's Plates <span class="smcap">xxii</span>. and
<span class="smcap">xxvi</span>., effigies at Gloucester and in the Temple Church,
London. The gamboised chausson is seen in this drawing
of an ivory chess-piece preserved in the Ashmolean
Museum. See also the effigy of a De Vere at Hatfield
Broadoak, (Stothard, Pl. <span class="smcap">xxxvi</span>.) An excellent example
of the pourpointed chausson worked in a rich diaper is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
offered by the brass of De Bures, 1302 (Waller, Pt. 2,
and Boutell's "Brasses and Slabs"). A curious variety
of the chausson and chausses is found in the figure of a
knight from Roy. MS. 2, A. xxii. fol. 219, given in our
woodcut, No. <a href="#i_281.jpg">62</a>; the chausson here being of chain-mail,
while the chausses appear to be of rivetted plates. A
chausson of chain-mail again appears in our cut, No. <a href="#i_369.jpg">86</a>,
from the Painted Chamber. To the chausson were usually
attached knee-pieces of some rigid material: metal, <i>cuir
bouilli</i>, or a mixture of both. See our woodcuts, Nos. <a href="#i_274.jpg">59</a>
and <a href="#i_284.jpg">63</a>; an effigy in Ash Church near Sandwich, and an
illumination from a German manuscript, Add. MS. 17,687,
both of the end of this century. Compare also the effigy
at Gosberton (Stothard, Pl. <span class="smcap">xxxvii</span>.), and those of De Vere
and De Bures cited above. Among the embellishments
of these poleyns are sometimes found little shields of
arms; as in our woodcut, No. <a href="#i_302.jpg">70</a>, the effigy of an unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
knight in Norton Church, Durham, c. 1300<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>, and
in the statue of Brian Fitz Alan, in Bedale Church, Yorkshire,
engraved in Hollis's Effigies, Pt. 4, and in Blore's
Monuments.</p>

<p>At the close of this century first appear the Greaves,
of metal or <i>cuir bouilli</i>, covering the front of the leg from
the knee to the instep. They were probably of German
introduction, for their Latin name was <i>BainbergÃ¦</i>, from
the German <i>Beinbergen</i>; and it seems likely that the
Germans may have copied them from the examples of
classic times with which they had become familiar during
their wars in Italy. In the south of Europe, the greaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
were already become of a highly ornamental character,
as we may see from this sculpture of Gulielmus Balnis,
1289, from a bas-relief in the Annunziata Convent at
Florence<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>; while in England they do not once appear
among our monumental effigies or on our royal seals.
Nor can a single example be found among the pictures
that adorned the royal palace of Westminster. They
are seen, however, among the illustrations of a manuscript
of Matthew Paris' Lives of the two Offas, (Cott.
MS., Nero, D. 1,) a work usually assigned to the thirteenth
century, but perhaps not earlier than the next
age. Our woodcut, No. <a href="#i_330.jpg">80</a>, has an example from this
manuscript, folio 7. On comparing the two engravings
given by us, it will be seen that, while the vellum
picture shews the defence below the knee only, the
Italian figure has it both below and above. The abundance
of ornament in the latter specimen seems to imply
a moulded material&mdash;<i>cuir bouilli</i>? Antique examples,
however, found at Pompeii and elsewhere, are of metal,
highly ornamented with chasing and embossed-work.
The name Bainberg occurs in several ancient documents.
In the Lex Ripuaria we have: "Bainbergas
bonas pro VI. sol. tribuat." And in the will of St.
Everard, duke of Frejus: "Bruniam unam, helmum 1.
et manicam 1. ad ipsam opus, <i>bemberga</i> II." &amp;c. And
again: "Bruniam unam cum halsberga et manicam
unam, <i>bemivergas</i> duas." The word in the last passage
being probably an error for <i>beinbergas</i>.</p>

<p>In the last quarter of the thirteenth century appear
those curious appendages to the knightly suit, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
Ailettes. But they do not occur in any frequency till
the beginning of the fourteenth century. We shall,
therefore, in noticing this novelty, refer to some examples
of the later period. From their name, <i>ailettes</i>,
Fr.; <i>alette</i>, Ital.; and <i>alettÃ¦</i> in the Latin of the period,
they appear to have been a French or Italian invention.
An early notice of them is in the Roll of Purchases for
the Windsor Tournament in 1278, where they are made of
leather covered with the kind of cloth called Carda. "De
eodem (Milo the Currier) xxxviij. par&#834; alect&#834; cor&#834; p'c&#772; par&#834;.
viij. d." "It&#834; pro xxxviij. par&#834; alett&#834; s&#834;. pro q&#778; par&#834; d&#299; uln&#772;
card. s&#834;. <span class="smcap">xix</span>. uln&#772;." They were fastened with silk laces,
supplied by "Richard Paternoster." "D RicÃµ pat&#834; nr&#834; viij.
Duoden&#772; laqueorum seri&#772;c pro alett&#834; p'&#772;c duoden&#772; viij. d.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>"
Sir Roger de Trumpington was one of the thirty-eight
knights engaged in this tournament, and it is remarkable
that his monumental brass furnishes one of the
earliest and best pictorial examples of the ailette that
has come down to us. (See our woodcut, No. <a href="#i_312.jpg">73</a>.)
There is one instance of it, and only one, in the pictures
of the Painted Chamber, Pl. <span class="smcap">xxxv</span>. It is ensigned with
a bird. In monumental statues it is very rare. The
figure here given is from a knightly tomb in the Church
of Ash-by-Sandwich, seemingly of the close of this century<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>.
The ailettes appear <i>behind</i> the shoulders, rising
from the slab beneath, about the eighth of an inch.
They have been quadrangular, the outer corners having
become broken by accident: there is no trace of any
fastening, and no remain of colour. The other monumental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a><br /><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a><br /><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
statues in England exhibiting the ailette are
those of a Pembridge in Clehongre Church, Herefordshire
(figured, with details, in Hollis's Effigies, Pt. 5),
and the so-called Crusader at Great Tew, Oxfordshire.
The Clehongre figure is especially curious as shewing
the ailette fastened by its "laqueus," which appears on
the outside. In Switzerland there is the statue of Rudolf
von Thierstein, at Basle: the ailettes here are square,
and fixed on the <i>side</i> of the figure. (Hefner, Pt. 2, Pl.
<span class="smcap">xli</span>.) Our English monumental brasses furnish several
examples. See those of Septvans and Buslingthorpe,
given by Waller, and the Gorleston brass, Plate <span class="smcap">li</span>. of
Stothard. The curious painted windows at Tewkesbury,
figured in full by Carter (Sculpture and Painting), and
in part by Shaw (Dress and Decorations), afford the best
illustration contributed by pictured glass. Good examples
are found in the ivory carvings and seals of the period.
The seals of Edward the Third, as duke and as king, are
well-known instances; and the ivory casket engraved by
Carter, Plates <span class="smcap">cxiii</span>. and <span class="smcap">cxiv</span>., offers a singular variety of
this accessory. Illuminated manuscripts furnish abundant
examples. See, for instance, Roy. MSS., 14, E. <span class="smcap">iii</span>.
and 2, B. <span class="smcap">vii</span>., and Add. MS. 10,292. The Louterell
Psalter has a good specimen, copied in Carter's work
named above, and in the <i>Vetusta Monumenta</i>. French
monumental examples, we learn from M. Allou, are very
scarce: "L'accessoire qui nous occupe est fort rare dans
les monuments franÃ§ais. Nous en trouvons des exemples

<p>The forms of the ailette are various: the most frequent
is the quadrangular, as in the Ash Church effigy given
above, and in this example from Add. MS. 10,293, fol.
58; a book <i>dated</i> in 1316. The round form occurs on
the ivory casket engraved in vol. 4 of the Journal of the
ArchÃ¦ological Association, and in Plates <span class="smcap">cxiii</span>. and <span class="smcap">cxiv</span>.
of Carter's Sculpture and Painting. The pentagonal is
seen in an illumination of
Sloane MS. 3,983, engraved
as the frontispiece to Strutt's
Dress and Habits; the cruciform,
in the figure of a
knight from Roy. MS., 2, A.
<span class="smcap">xxii</span>. fol. 219 (our woodcut,
No. <a href="#i_281.jpg">62</a>). And on folio 94<sup>vo</sup>.
of Roy. MS., 14, E. iij. is an
example, the only one ever
observed by the writer, of a
lozenge-formed ailette. It
is clear, from the Cross on the shield having the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
position as the other, that the ailette is not a square one
worn awry.</p>

<p>The size of this appendage differs greatly in different
monuments. In the round example of the ivory casket,
cited above, it is scarcely larger than the palm of the
hand: while, in an illumination of Roy. MS., 20, D. 1,
fol. 18<sup>vo</sup>, it is little less than the ordinary shield of the
period. Its position is generally behind the shoulder, or
at the side of it: sometimes it appears in front: but too
strict an interpretation must not be given to the rude
memorials of these times.</p>

<p>The use of the ailette has somewhat perplexed antiquarian
writers. The French archÃ¦ologists of the present
day confess that it is "difficile d'en expliquer
l'usage<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>." Some writers have considered it as a simply
defensive provision: others look upon it as an ensign,
to indicate to his followers the place of a leader in the
field. Against the supposition that it was <i>merely</i> armorial,
may be urged that in many cases it has no
heraldic bearing at all: sometimes it has a cross only,
sometimes a diaper pattern, and sometimes it is quite
blank. See examples of all these varieties in the Tewkesbury
glass paintings, the Gorleston brass (Stothard, Pl.
<span class="smcap">li</span>.), and the Buslingthorpe brass (Waller, Pt. 10). In
vellum pictures it is often seen worn by knights in the
tilt; where the heraldic bearings already exhibited on
the shield, crest, and surcoat of the rider, and on the
caparisons of the horse, would to no useful purpose be
repeated on the ailette. In the case of the Clehongre
example, quoted above, the outside knotting of the lace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
does not seem consistent with the display of armorial
distinctions on the wing beneath. In Germany they
are called <i>Tartschen</i> (Hefner: <i>Trachten</i>, Pt. 2, Pl. <span class="smcap">xli</span>.),
and their purpose of shields seems most in accordance
with the numerous ancient evidences in which they
appear. The knights, indeed, not content with their
panoply of steel, seem in the course of the middle-ages
to have fortified themselves with a complete outwork
of shields. Thus we have the ailettes, the shield proper,
the <i>garde-bras</i>, or elbow-shield, the shoulder-shield, the
<i>Beinschiene</i>, or shield for the legs, the vamplate on the
lance, and the steel front of the saddle, which was in
fact but another shield for the defence of the knight's
body. Referring once more to the Clehongre effigy, it
will be observed that, while the "dÃ©faut de la cuirasse"
(where the arm joins the body) is strengthened <i>in front</i>
with a steel roundel, this assailable point is covered at
the <i>back of the arm</i> with the ailette. See the Details on
Hollis's third plate of this monument. The analogy between
these defences and those curious upright pieces of
steel on the shoulders, so frequent in the armours of the
sixteenth century, will at once be recognised.</p>

<p>Ailettes of a superb construction appear in the Inventory
of the effects of Piers Gaveston in 1313: "Item,
autres divers garnementz des armes le dit Pieres, ovek
les alettes garniz et frettez de perles<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>." They are named
also in the Inventory of the goods of Umfrey de Bohun
in 1322: "iiij peire de alettes des armes le Counte de
Hereford<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>."</p>

<p>Besides the defences of chain-mail, which, as we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a><br /><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a><br /><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
seen, formed the usual armour of the knights of the thirteenth
century, there were other materials occasionally
employed for the warrior's habit. Scale-work still appears,
though in but few monuments; and it seems to
have been used for small portions only of the equipment.
See the brass figured by Waller, Part x., and
Boutell, page 113.</p>

<p>In this singular figure of a knight from Roy. MS. 2, A.
xxii. fol. 219, the leg-defences are composed of a kind of
Bezanted Armour: small roundels of metal, placed contiguously,
appear to be rivetted to a fabric of cloth or to
leather: forming a garment very similar to the "penny
plate armour" of the sixteenth century. In the original
drawing, the chausses are shaded with blue: but, singularly
enough, the chausson is shaded with red, though it
seems clearly to be intended for chain-mail. The date of
the figure appears to be about the close of the thirteenth
century. As a curious illustration of bezanted armour,
the late Mr. Hudson Turner told the writer of these pages
that he had seen in an ancient record an account of a hauberk
of Edward III., studded with gold florins; though,
with the usual caution of the antiquarian discoverer, he
withheld the name and locality of the document.</p>

<p>In the engraving given overleaf, from Add. MS. 17,687,
a German illumination of the end of this century, we
have an example of Studded armour. Garments presenting
an exterior sprinkled with studs are of frequent occurrence
in the next age, and we shall therefore freely
use the memorials of that time in illustration of our subject;
and indeed we may gather some valuable evidences
from existing armours of Eastern manufacture. Many a
mystery of middle-age lore may be unravelled by an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
attentive examination of Oriental productions. As the
surface only of the military studded garments is presented
to our view in ancient monuments, we can seldom determine
with exactness their construction: but, from the
comparison of various examples, it seems probable that
there were not less than four or five varieties of this kind
of apparel. First, we have quilted-work, in which the
studs appear to be used for holding together the component
parts of the fabric. We have already noticed an
example of the kind in our preceding division (woodcut,
No. <a href="#i_162.jpg">37</a>). The engraving now before us seems to represent
a similar armour: the spots are coloured of a
red-brown on a ground of light grey. In the fine manuscript
of Meliadus, Add. MS. 12,228, not only parts of
the knightly suit, but the saddles of the horses, are seeded
with studs; which seems distinctly to imply a quilted
covering. See also the effigies engraved by Stothard,
(Plates <span class="smcap">lx</span>. and <span class="smcap">lxiii</span>.) And in the Tower collection
will be found Chinese armour of modern date, formed of
a quilted garment sprinkled with metal studs. The next
kind of Studded armour is that of which a real specimen
of the fourteenth century was found by Dr. Hefner in
the excavations of the old Castle of Tannenberg in Germany:
a relic which throws the clearest light on the
costume of many a knightly effigy of that period. The
defence is thus contrived: strips of metal, like hooping,
are placed horizontally across the body, the upper edge
of each splint being perforated for rivets. These strips
slightly overlap each other: a piece of velvet, or other
material of a similar kind, is then laid over the whole,
and by rows of rivets fastened to the iron splints beneath.
The velvet being of a rich hue, and the rivet-heads gilt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a><br /><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a><br /><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
or silvered, the garment presents exactly the appearance
of those knightly suits in which spots of gold or silver
are seen studding the whole superficies of a dress of
crimson or other brilliant tincture. The relic in question
is figured and minutely described in the admirable tract
on the results of the find by Doctors Hefner and Wolf:
"Die Burg Tannenberg und ihre Ausgrabungen." The
Stapelton brass, of which there is a facsimile in the
Craven Ord Collection in the British Museum, and an
engraving in Stothard's work, and the brass at Aveley in
Essex (Waller, Pt. 1), seem to exhibit the armour in
question. Foreign examples occur in the figures of
Conrad von Saunsheim and those in Bamberg Cathedral,
given by Hefner in Part II. of the <i>Trachten</i>. The jazerant
coats of the fifteenth century, of which several real specimens
yet remain to us, are of a very similar construction.
A third kind of Stud-work seems to differ from
the articulated sort described above, in its basis being
uniform and rigid, while the surface exhibits the same
features, of a coloured ground-work spangled with bosses
of gold or silver. See Stothard's Plates <span class="smcap">lxxvi</span>. and <span class="smcap">xciii</span>.
A fourth variety appears to be described in this passage
of the Inventory of the effects of Piers Gaveston: "Item,
en un autre coffre une peire de plates enclouez et garniz
d'argent, od quatre cheynes d'argent, coverz dun drap de
velvet vermail besaunte d'or<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>." Here we have a garment
of velvet spotted with gold, covering an armour nailed
with silver: clearly, therefore, differing from the preceding
kinds, where the rivets unite the component materials
into one vestment. A further item of the Inventory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
seems to shew still more clearly that the velvet
coat (whether bezanted or not) was distinct from the iron
defence: "Item, deux cotes de velvet pur plates coverir."
Finally, another kind of studded military garment, of
which we trace the existence through the examples of
Modern Asia, consisted of several thicknesses of pliable
stuff, held together by rivets with bossed heads which
appear on the surface. In the Museum of the United
Service Institution may be seen a Chinese armour constructed
after this method, but having the coat lined at
the breast with a few plates of iron about the size of
playing-cards. In other examples, the studs are not
rivetted, but only sewn down upon the garment.</p>

</div>

<p>Towards the close of the thirteenth century we find an
armour offering a new appearance, to which has been
given the name of Banded Mail. Notwithstanding much
careful consideration, its exact structure has not yet been
discovered, though the representations of it are very
abundant. For a whole century, manuscript illuminations,
monumental brasses, painted windows, royal and
baronial seals, metal chasings and sculptures of various
kinds, afford us an infinity of examples; in none of which
has hitherto been detected the exact evidence either of
its material or its construction. Monumental sculptures,
from their large size and the careful finish of their details,
might have been expected to solve a problem which
they only perplex. The effigy<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> here engraved, of a knight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a><br /><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a><br /><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
of the De Sulney family, exhibits the warrior armed from
head to foot in a suit of banded-mail; and in the following
woodcut we have given a portion of the armour
of this figure, of its real size. The profile view has been
copied with particular care, in the hope that it might be
of use in determining the structure of this very singular
defence. By many writers this fabric has been described
as pourpointerie; by others it has been considered as
only a conventional mode of representing the ordinary
chain-mail. Mr. Kerrich, whose opinions will always be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
received with, the greatest respect, speaking of the rows
of little arcs used to express the latter defence, says:
"When there are lines between the rows, whether <i>two</i>
or only one, I conceive it means still but the same
thing<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>." M. Pottier, in the text to Willemin's <i>Monuments
InÃ©dits</i>, does not distinguish the so-called banded-mail
from the other, but names it simply "armure de
mailles<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>." But it seems difficult to believe that the
common chain-mail could be intended, so widely different
are the two modes of representation, whether in sculpture
or in painting. Observe, for instance, the details&mdash;especially
the portion in profile&mdash;from the effigy at Newton
Solney. And in the following subject from the Romance
of Meliadus, (Add. MS. 12,228, f. 79,) there seems no
assignable reason for marking one figure so differently
from the rest, unless the armour itself were of a distinct
kind<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>That the banded defences under consideration were of
pourpointing is still more unlikely; for a gamboised
garment, whether of velvet, silk, cloth, or whatever
material, would, in painted representations, exhibit those
various <i>colours</i> which are so lavishly displayed in the
other portions of the knightly attire. Yet a careful
examination of many hundred figures in illuminated
manuscripts has failed in detecting a single instance of
positive colour on banded-mail, except such as may be
referred to the metals. Green, scarlet, crimson, diaper
or ray, never appear. But gold or a golden tincture,
silver or white, and grey of various shades, occur continually.
And all these seem to indicate a fabric in
which metal plays at least a conspicuous part. The examples
among vellum-paintings, in which the banding is
tinted grey or left white, are so numerous that one can
scarcely open a manuscript of the period without finding
them. Instances of it in silver may be seen in Cotton
MSS., Vitellius, A. xiii., and Nero, D. vi.; in Roy. MS.
20, D. i., and Add. MS. 12,228. On folio 217<sup>vo</sup>. of the
last-named book will be found the figure of a knight
whose banded-mail is gilt. The same kind of armour,
in gold colour, appears in the windows of Beer Ferrers
Church, Devonshire, and of Fulborn Church, Cambridgeshire.
See Lysons' Devonshire, p. 326, and Kerrich
Collections, Add. MS. 6,730, fol. 61, for faithful copies
of these examples. If from the foregoing evidences we
derive the belief that the basis of this fabric was metal,
from a monument figured in the superb work of Count
Bastard, <i>Peintures des Manuscrits, &amp;c.</i>, we gather that
the lines of arcs were rings; for the fillet that binds
the coif round the temples is clearly passed through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
alternate groups of rings, exactly as in the ordinary
mail-hood. The figure is from a French Bible of the
beginning of the fourteenth century, and occurs
in the seventh number of the <i>Peintures</i>.
In fairness we must admit that this example
is not altogether inadmissible as an evidence
in favour of the theory of common chain-mail.
And on that side may be ranged the very curious
figure of Offa the First, given in our woodcut, No. <a href="#i_330.jpg">80</a>,
from the "Lives of the Two Offas," by Matthew Paris
(Cott. MS., Nero, D. i. fol. 7); where the upper part of
the warrior's coif is of "banded-mail," while the lower
portion is marked in the manner usually adopted to express
the ordinary chain-mail.</p>

<p>Different from all these is the interpretation offered
by M. de Vigne in his <i>Recueil de Costumes du Moyen-Age</i>.
On Plate <span class="smcap">lvi</span>. of that work, the author has given
a series of sketches, shewing the supposed construction
of various ancient armours. The banded mail is represented
as formed of rows of overlapping rings, sewn
down on leather or other similar material, "avec les
coutures couvertes de petites bandes de cuir." Von
Leber, in his sketch of medieval armour, has the same
notion: "Vom 13. his nach Anfang des 14. Jahrh. der
lederstreifige Ringharnisch als unschÃ¶ne und unbequeme
RitterhÃ¼lle<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>." This interpretation, however, is at variance
with those ancient monuments where the <i>inside</i> of
the defence exhibits the ring-work as well as the exterior.
See our print of the De Sulney effigy. A more improbable
garment, to say the least of it, than a hauberk of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
leather, <i>faced</i> with mail and <i>lined</i> with mail, can scarcely
be conceived. Other examples of the hauberk, shewing
the banding on the inside, are furnished by the brass of
De Creke (Waller, Pt. viii.; Boutell, p. 39), a brass at
Minster, Isle of Sheppey (Stothard, Pl. <span class="smcap">liv</span>.; Boutell,
p. 42), in the effigy of Sir John D'Aubernoun (Stothard,
Pl. <span class="smcap">lx</span>.), and the brass at Ghent, figured in the ArchÃ¦ological
Journal, vol. vii. p. 287.</p>

<p>Sometimes the knight's horse is barded with banded-mail,
as in the figure from a manuscript in the Library
of Cambrai, given by De Vigne in his <i>Recueil de Costumes</i>,
vol. ii., plate <span class="smcap">viii</span>. In Roy. MS. 20, D. i. fol. 330,
a work of about the close of the thirteenth century, are
elephants with similar caparisons: on their backs are
castles, full of fighting men.</p>

<p>We have already noticed that four sculptured effigies
with banded-mail have been observed in England. The
Tewkesbury figure is given by Stothard; an example
further curious from the hauberk being sculptured as
ordinary chain-mail, while the camail alone is of the
banded work. In the "Memoirs," p. 125, Stothard,
writing of this camail to Mr. Kerrich, says: "Amongst
other curious things I have met with, is a figure which
has some remarkable points about it; but, for the discovery
of these, I devoted a whole day in clearing away
a thick coating of whitewash which concealed them.
The mail attached to the helmet was of that kind so
frequently represented in drawings, and which you have
had doubts whether it was not another way of representing
that sort we are already acquainted with. I
am sorry that I know no more of its construction now
than before I met with it." The effigy at Dodford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
near Weedon, is engraved in Baker's Northamptonshire,
vol. i. p. 360. The knight has hauberk, chausses and
coif of banded-mail, with poleyns, coutes and cervelliÃ¨re
of plate. The figure at Tollard Royal, Wilts, has not
been engraved; but from some memorandums kindly
furnished by a friend, it appears that this knight is
habited in hauberk, chausses and coif of banded-mail,
with a skull-cap of plate.</p>

   <p class="caption3">No. 68.</p>
</div>

<p>Compare also the effigy of gilded metal in Westminster
Abbey, of William de Valence, who died in 1296
(Stothard, Pl. <span class="smcap">xliv</span>.). In the following figures, from a
German manuscript of about 1280, copied from Hefner's
<i>Trachten</i>, it will be observed that each knight differs
from his fellow in the manner of his equipment, though
the staple defence of all is the banded-mail. Other examples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
of this kind of armour will be found in our woodcuts,
No. <a href="#i_222.jpg">47</a>, <a href="#i_226.jpg">48</a>, <a href="#i_284.jpg">63</a>, <a href="#i_310.jpg">72</a> and <a href="#i_323.jpg">77</a>. At last, we can establish
no definite conclusion. Our proofs are but of a
negative character. Yet it is always something, to have
determined what a thing is not. It seems pretty clear,
then, from the absence of varied colours which we have
remarked, that the Banded-mail is not pourpointerie of
any kind. And, from the presence of the ring-work on
the inside of the armour as well as the outside, it appears
not to be of the construction suggested by the German
and Belgian antiquaries. If meant for ordinary chain-mail,
it must be confessed that the medieval artists never
hit upon a mode of expressing this material so little
resembling the original. It is to the further examination
of ancient evidences, or to the discovery of monuments
hitherto unobserved, that we must look for a
satisfactory solution of this knightly mystery.</p>

<div class="figright" >

   <p class="caption3">No. 69.</p>
</div>

<p>In addition to the various armours already noticed,
we find in the thirteenth century the defence expressed
by cross-lines which we have remarked in the earlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
periods. Good examples occur on folio 9 of Roy. MS.
12, F. xiii., and in Laing's Scottish Seals, Plate <span class="smcap">iv</span>.</p>

<p>And in a chess-piece of the early part of this century,
the markings of the armour are made in a very peculiar
manner: by rows of drilled holes divided by lines.
(Woodcut <a href="#i_296.jpg">69</a>.) This seems to be the device of a rude
artist to express the ordinary chain-mail. The example
was first brought into prominent notice in the pages of
the ArchÃ¦ological Journal, vol. iii. p. 241.</p>

<p>Occasionally, but very rarely, the chain-mail was indicated
in monumental statues by merely painting the
links on a flat surface. The effigy of a De l'Isle in
Rampton Church, Cambridgeshire, engraved by Stothard,
Plate <span class="smcap">xxi</span>., affords a good instance of this method.</p>

<p>A further singularity of the period is that the chain-mail
sometimes presents a surface of a hue which does
not appear consistent with a defence of steel. The effigy
of LonguespÃ©e at Salisbury (woodcut No. <a href="#i_259.jpg">54</a>) has the
armour painted brown. The centre figure in our woodcut
No. <a href="#i_257.jpg">53</a> wears a hauberk which is marked with buff
on a white ground, the other hauberks being blue. The
knight on woodcut No. <a href="#i_281.jpg">62</a> has a chausson shaded with
red. And in Harl. MSS. 1,526 and 1,527 are many
figures in which the chain-mail markings appear on a
bright red ground. It seems probable, however, that
such variations may be charged on the caprice of the
artists; as in the colourings of the Bayeux tapestry,
where the near legs of the horses are made blue, while
the off legs are yellow.</p>

<p>Among the knightly effigies in the Temple Church,
London, is a figure which seems to require an especial
notice; the armour being of a fashion not elsewhere remarked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
It consists of a back and breast-piece, each in
a single part, united at the sides by straps. The sculpture
being in stone, without any painting preserved, it
is of course impossible to ascertain the material which
the artist desired to represent. It may have been leather
(the <i>cuirie</i>, of which we have already noted the existence);
but there seems no good reason why it should
not have been iron: and if so, it is perhaps the earliest
example of a body-armour formed of a "pair of plates
large<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>" that Europe has to offer. The effigy in question
lies at the south-east corner of the group in the Round
Church.</p>

<p>About the beginning of the thirteenth century arose
the use of the military <span class="smcap">Surcoat</span>. The first English
monarch who, on his Great Seal, appears in this garment,
is King John: 1199-1216. (See our woodcut,
No. <a href="#i_255.jpg">52</a>.) The seal of the dauphin Louis, the rival of
John, (appended to Harleian Charter, 43, B. 37, dated
1216,) has it also. The earliest Scottish king who wears
the surcoat is Alexander the Second: 1214-1249: a
fine impression of his seal is attached to Cotton Charter,
xix. 2. Imaginative writers have affirmed that this garment
was first used by the Crusaders, in order to mitigate
the discomfort of the metal hauberk, "so apt to get
heated under a Syrian sun." Cotemporary authority,
however, expressly tells us that its purpose was to defend
the armour from the wet:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Surcoat was of two principal kinds: the sleeveless
and the sleeved. The latter is not found till the second
half of the century.</p>

<p>The Sleeveless Surcoat occurs of various lengths:
sometimes scarcely covering the hauberk, sometimes
reaching to the heels. Both the short and the long are
seen throughout the century. The long appear on the
royal seals noticed above. And on the seal of De Quinci,
circa 1250 (woodcut, No. <a href="#i_373.jpg">87</a>); on the sculpture from
Haseley, c. 1250 (cut, No. <a href="#i_219.jpg">46</a>); on the brass of D'Aubernoun,
1277 (No. <a href="#i_264.jpg">55</a>); on that of De Trumpington, 1289
(No. <a href="#i_312.jpg">73</a>); on the effigies at Ash and Norton, of the close
of the century (Nos. <a href="#i_274.jpg">59</a> and <a href="#i_302.jpg">70</a>); and on the statues of
De Vere and Crouchback (Stothard, Plates <span class="smcap">xxxvi</span>. and
<span class="smcap">xlii</span>.).</p>

<p>The shorter Surcoat occurs on the effigy of LonguespÃ©e,
d. 1226 (woodcut, No. <a href="#i_259.jpg">54</a>); the knight at Whitworth, c.
1250 (Stothard, Pl. <span class="smcap">xxiv</span>.); the figures from the Painted
Chamber and the "Lives of the Two Offas" (woodcuts,
Nos. <a href="#i_330.jpg">80</a> and <a href="#i_369.jpg">86</a>); the knight at Florence, 1289 (cut No.
<a href="#i_271.jpg">58</a>); De Valence, in Westminster Abbey (Stothard, Pl.
<span class="smcap">xliv</span>.); and our engravings, Nos. <a href="#i_222.jpg">47</a>, <a href="#i_265.jpg">56</a>, <a href="#i_284.jpg">63</a>, <a href="#i_288.jpg">64</a> and <a href="#i_295.jpg">68</a>:
the last-named examples being of the close of the century.</p>

<p>The Surcoat is either of a uniform tint, or diapered, or
heraldically pictured. Probably, in some early sculptured
effigies, the surcoat, now plain, had armorial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
devices expressed by painting, which time has obliterated.
The armorial surcoat was a necessary result of
the visored helm; for when the visor was closed, it
was no longer possible to distinguish king from subject,
leader from stranger, comrade from foe. A similar inconvenience
had already been found in the nasal helmet.
At the field of Hastings, Duke William was obliged to remove
the bar from his face, in order to convince his followers
that he was still alive. The figure of LonguespÃ©e
at Salisbury, c. 1226, still exhibits a portion of the
heraldic decoration of the surcoat. And it is again
found on the statue of De l'Isle at Rampton, circa 1250
(Stothard, Pl. <span class="smcap">xx</span>.). The pictures of the Painted Chamber
offer many examples. (See our woodcut, No. <a href="#i_369.jpg">86</a>.) See
also our engravings, Nos. <a href="#i_271.jpg">58</a> and <a href="#i_281.jpg">62</a>. The effigy of
William de Valence in Westminster Abbey, circa 1296,
offers a curious variety of this garment: it is powdered
with escutcheons, on each of which are the bearings of
his house. A similar arrangement is seen in one of the
figures of the Painted Chamber (Plate <span class="smcap">vi</span>.)</p>

<p>The knightly surcoat of this time was slit up in front
and behind, for convenience of riding. A singular deviation
from this fashion of the garment is found in a figure
in the Cathedral of Constance, c. 1220; where from the
front part a portion passes under the arms, overlaps the
part hanging from the shoulders behind, and then fastens
at the back. See Hefner's work, Pl. <span class="smcap">iv</span>. of Pt. i.</p>

<p>Occasionally the surcoat has an ornamental edge of
fringe; as in the brasses of D'Aubernoun, 1277, and De
Bures, 1302 (woodcut, No. <a href="#i_264.jpg">55</a>, and Waller, Pt. ii.). In
some cases, as in the Temple Church figure engraved by
Stothard, Pl. <span class="smcap">xv</span>., the garment has a rigid appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
across the shoulders, which has been taken to indicate
a strengthening of the surcoat at that part. But the
same treatment is seen in the enamelled effigy at St.
Denis, of John, son of St. Louis; where the garment
forms part of a civil dress (Willemin, vol. i., Pl. <span class="smcap">xci</span>.,
and Guilhermy's Monuments of St. Denis, p. 164). The
Surcoat sometimes hangs loose, as in our woodcut, No.
<a href="#i_369.jpg">86</a>; but usually it is girt at the waist by a cord or strap.
The cord is seen in the brasses of Sir John D'Aubernoun
and Sir Roger de Trumpington; the strap, with its long
pendent end, in the effigies at Ash Church, Norton
Church, and St. Bride's (our woodcuts, Nos. <a href="#i_264.jpg">55</a>, <a href="#i_312.jpg">73</a>, <a href="#i_274.jpg">59</a>,
<a href="#i_302.jpg">70</a> and <a href="#i_314.jpg">74</a>). The group from Add. MS. 17,687 furnishes
some further examples (cut, No. <a href="#i_284.jpg">63</a>). Rarely, the surcote
is made with a "fente" at the throat, and fastened with
a fibula. An effigy in the Temple Church exhibits this
arrangement. (Hollis, Pt. ii.)</p>

<p>The Sleeved Surcoat, as we have already noticed, did
not come into use till the second half of the thirteenth
century. It is frequent in the pictures of the Painted
Chamber. A good example is offered by the effigy at
Norton, Durham (our woodcut, No. <a href="#i_302.jpg">70</a>); and very similar
are found in the statue of Lord Fitz Alan at Bedale,
Yorkshire, (engraved by Hollis, Pt. iv., and in Blore's
Monuments,) and the Temple sculpture (Stothard, Pl.
<span class="smcap">xxxviii</span>.). The knightly figure on our woodcut No. <a href="#i_265.jpg">56</a>
presents a variety, in the sleeves being "slittered."
Those of the Shurland effigy (Stothard, Pl. <span class="smcap">xli</span>.) are
divided under the arm and fastened by ties.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Helmets</span> of the thirteenth century, though offering
many points of difference on comparing particular
examples, may yet be readily thrown into distinguishable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a><br /><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a><br /><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a><br /><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a><br /><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
classes. The first division that Suggests itself is
that of the Helm (the great, close casque of the knight)
and the Helmet, a defence, as the word indicates, of
diminished completeness. The Helm must again be
divided into two leading kinds: that in which the
plates forming it are all rivetted together, so as to make
one piece; and that in which the front is provided with
a moveable ventail. The successive changes of fashion
supply a further division of the helms; giving us the
flat-topped, the round-topped, and the "sugar-loaf" form.
The Helmets may be classed as the hemispherical, the
cylindrical, the conical, the wide-rimmed (Petasus form),
and the nasal. Besides which are some varieties of peculiar
construction, which may be better noticed after the
more general forms have been considered.</p>

<p>The word Helm among the Northern nations merely
meant a covering of any kind: the <i>WÃ¦rhelm</i> of the
Anglo-Saxons was the little cap worn by the soldier,
of which we have seen many examples in our previous
inquiries. But from the end of the twelfth century,
when the great casque enclosing the whole head, like
that seen on the second seal of King Richard, came
into use, the term helm or heaume was restricted to
this new kind of headpiece.</p>

<p>The flat-topped Helm forming a single structure, appears
usually in one of the following fashions. I. A cylinder
having bands in front forming a cross, and sometimes
similar bands crossing on the crown, which is slightly
convex or conical; two horizontal clefts for vision, but
without holes for breathing. Examples occur in our
woodcut, No. <a href="#i_305.jpg">71</a>, fig. 1, from the statue of Hugh Fitz
Eudo, in Kirkstead Chapel, Lincolnshire; in the chess-knight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
(woodcut <a href="#i_270.jpg">57</a>); in the Whitworth effigy (Stothard,
Pl. <span class="smcap">xxiv</span>.); in the carvings of the Presbytery arcade of
Worcester Cathedral (woodcut <a href="#i_305.jpg">71</a>, fig. 2); all these
early in the century: and in the groups of the Painted
Chamber. II. A cylinder with the cross-bands as before;
but, in addition to the ocularium, having apertures for
breathing. This kind is seen in our woodcut <a href="#i_305.jpg">71</a>, fig. 3,
from Hefner's <i>Trachten</i>; in the Walkerne effigy (Hollis,
Pt. i.); in the sculptures of the front of Wells Cathedral,
circa 1225; in the miniatures of the Lives of the Offas
(Cott. MS., Nero, D.i.); and in the seal of Hugo de Vere,
earl of Oxford (woodcut <a href="#i_305.jpg">71</a>, fig. 4). III. A cylinder
with ocularium and breathing-holes, but not having the
cross-bands: woodcut <a href="#i_305.jpg">71</a>, fig. 5, from the very curious
drawing on folio 27 of Harl. MS. 3,244, date about 1250.
IV. In this variety, the front part is rounded below, has
ocularium, but not any breathing-holes: woodcut <a href="#i_305.jpg">71</a>, fig.
6, from the seal of Alexander II. of Scotland, 1214-1249
(Cott. Charter, XIX. 2); and compare the seal of
Louis the Dauphin, circa 1216. V. This kind resembles
the last, except that it is provided with apertures for
breathing. A good example is furnished by the seal of
Robert Fitz Walter, of the second half of the century:
woodcut <a href="#i_305.jpg">71</a>, fig. 7.</p>

<p>We must remark also the difference existing among
these helms on the point of ornament. Some are altogether
plain; as in our woodcuts <a href="#i_270.jpg">57</a> and <a href="#i_305.jpg">71</a>, and the
Whitworth effigy (Stothard, Pl. <span class="smcap">xxiv</span>.): others have a
profusion of ornament, as in the knightly figure from
Roy. MS. 2, A. xxii. (woodcut, No. <a href="#i_281.jpg">62</a>). The term
cylindrical, which has been applied to them, must not
always be understood literally. In woodcut No. <a href="#i_270.jpg">57</a> we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
have a true cylinder; but in other cases, the helm swells
at the sides, taking the "barrel" form, as in the second
seal of Henry III. (woodcut <a href="#i_334.jpg">81</a>); or, when viewed in
profile, it presents a concave line behind, as in the seal
of De Quinci (woodcut, No. <a href="#i_373.jpg">87</a>), or, more strikingly, in
the example at Worcester (woodcut <a href="#i_305.jpg">71</a>, fig. 2).</p>

<p>The helm was worn over the coif of chain-mail. An
ivory carving engraved in the sixteenth volume of the
<i>ArchÃ¦logia</i> affords an excellent illustration of this
usage; the knight being there represented in the act
of raising his helm from his head armed in the <i>coiffe
de mailles</i>.</p>

<p>The flat-topped cylindrical Helm, with moveable ventail,
appears about the middle of the century. The
figure of Ferdinand, King of Castille, in the windows
of Chartres Cathedral, affords a good example. He
died in 1252: the monument is engraved by Willemin,
vol. i., Pl. <span class="smcap">xcvii</span>.: the helm is fig. 8 of our cut <a href="#i_305.jpg">71</a>.
A real helm of this type is in the Tower collection:
the ventail opens by means of hinges on the side (see
ArchÃ¦ol. Journal, vol. viii., p. 420, and our woodcut <a href="#i_305.jpg">71</a>,
fig. 9). It is entirely of iron, weighing 13lb. 8oz. And
it is not unworthy of remark, that a much later helm,
one with the beaked visor characteristic of the close of
the fourteenth century, also in the Tower of London,
differs in weight from the above example by only four
ounces. (ArchÃ¦ol. Journal, vol. ix., p. 93.) The moveable
ventail seems to be portrayed also on the second
seal of Henry III., and on the seal of Edward I. (woodcuts,
No. <a href="#i_334.jpg">81</a> and <a href="#i_366.jpg">85</a>).</p>

<p>About 1270 the round-topped Helm came into vogue:
not, however, to the entire exclusion of the old fashion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
of which examples are found to the end of this century,
and even during a portion of the next. See our Plate
<span class="smcap"><a href="#i_305.jpg">lxxi</a></span>., fig. 10, from Cotton Roll, <span class="smcap">xv</span>. 7. The seal of Patrick
Dunbar, tenth earl of March, affords another good illustration
of the helm with round crown: engraved in Laing's
"Ancient Scottish Seals," p. 54. It has moveable ventail,
with apertures for sight and breathing, as before. Other
instances occur in the groups of the "Painted Chamber"
and the "Lives of the Offas." A very curious variety of
this type is furnished in the seal of Louis of Savoy, 1294;
where the ventail has the form of an eagle displayed,
the clefts for sight and air being contrived between the
plumes of the wings. (Figured by Cibrario, in the <i>Sigilli
de' Principi di Savoia</i>, Pl. <span class="smcap">xxx</span>., and in our woodcut,
No. <a href="#i_305.jpg">71</a>, fig. 11.)</p>

<p>About 1280 the Helm takes the "sugar-loaf" form;
having bands which make a cross in the front of it. See
woodcut, No. <a href="#i_305.jpg">71</a>, fig. 12, from Roy. MS. 20, D. i.; and
the brass of Sir Roger de Trumpington, 1289 (woodcut,
No. <a href="#i_312.jpg">73</a>). It will be observed that this kind of heaume
is continued so low as to rest on the shoulders.</p>

<p>It is not improbable that some of these casques were
formed in part of leather. An early helm made of cuir-bouilli,
with iron bands, is figured by Hefner (<i>Trachten</i>,
Pt. ii., Pl. <span class="smcap">lxviii</span>.); and for the Windsor tournament of
1278, were provided "<span class="smcap">xxxviii</span>. galee de cor&#834;."</p>

<p>The helm was made fast by laces. In the Romance of
Perceval, the hero</p>

<p>In order to recover the helm if struck off in the <i>mÃªlÃ©e</i>
it was attached to some part of
the knight's equipment by a
chain. The brass of Sir Roger
de Trumpington (cut, No. <a href="#i_312.jpg">73</a>)
supplies us with an illustration.
And this usage is noticed in the
Romance of <i>Le tournois de Chauvenei</i>,
written about 1285:&mdash;</p>

<p>Crests are frequently found surmounting
the helm at the close of
this century; but they are not of
that distinctive kind, consisting
of lions, griffins, eagles, wings,
axes, and-so-forth, which appear
in such diversity during the next age. They are merely
of the fan form. The seal of De Quinci, indeed, seems an
evidence to the contrary, and has been often described as
an instance of a helm of the early part of the thirteenth
century bearing a wyvern for a crest (woodcut, No. <a href="#i_373.jpg">87</a>).
But the wyvern in the upper part of this seal seems to be
placed there merely to fill up the space between the letters,
and belongs to the legend, not to the effigy; just as
we see a flower occupying the space beneath the lion's
feet, and in the obverse of the seal, the wyvern filling up
the void beneath the horse and under the housing. Heraldic
bearings do in fact appear on the casques of several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
figures previously to 1300. But they form part of the
headpiece itself: they do not surmount it. The helm of
Richard the First has a lion, but it is a figure embossed
or painted on a part of the casque. The well-known
effigy of a Plantagenet (Stothard, Pl. <span class="smcap">ii</span>.) is an analogous
instance. The monument of Le Botiler at St. Bride's,
Glamorganshire, (woodcut, No. <a href="#i_314.jpg">74</a>,) affords another example:
and in the curious helm of Louis of Savoy
(woodcut <a href="#i_305.jpg">71</a>, fig. 11) we have the heraldic eagle forming
the <i>visor</i> of the casque, while the crest is composed
of the usual fan ornament. This fan we have already
seen on the helm of Richard I., but it does not come
into general use till towards the close of the thirteenth
century. See examples on our woodcuts, Nos. <a href="#i_305.jpg">71</a> and
<a href="#i_310.jpg">72</a>. Other instances may be found in Laing's "Scottish
Seals," p. 54; in the Lives of the Offas, Cott. MS., Nero,
D. i.; and in great number among the miniatures of
Roy. MS. 20, D. i., where they are attached to the
heads of the horses as well as to the helms. At the
Windsor tournament in 1278, also, crests were provided
both for man and horse:&mdash;</p>

<p>Another curious appendage to the knightly helm of
this time consisted of Horns; made, as we learn from
Guillaume le Breton, of whalebone, and borne for the
purpose of striking terror by the gigantic appearance of
the wearer. The Count of Boulogne at the Battle of
Bovines, in 1214, adopts this expedient:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Helms of kings have a crown encircling them, as
seen in the seals of Henry III. and Edward I. of England
(woodcuts, No. <a href="#i_326.jpg">79</a>, <a href="#i_334.jpg">81</a> and <a href="#i_366.jpg">85</a>); but on the capelline
of King John is no such ornament. See also our engraving,
No. <a href="#i_310.jpg">72</a>. The crown is occasionally placed on
the coif of chain-mail: as on folio 7 of the Lives of the
Offas (woodcut, No. <a href="#i_330.jpg">80</a>), and in the pictures of the
Painted Chamber.</p>

<p>Of the smaller casque&mdash;helmet, or chapel-de-fer&mdash;we
have already observed that some were worn beneath the
coif-de-mailles. Others were placed above it, or formed
of themselves the whole arming of the head. They are
cylindrical, hemispherical, conical, wide-rimmed, and of
the nasal kind. The first-named appears in our woodcut,
No. <a href="#i_257.jpg">53</a>, from Harl. MS. 5,102, of the beginning of the
century. It is found also on the seal of St. Louis, and
in the effigy in the Temple Church, figured by Stothard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
Pl. <span class="smcap">x</span>. The rounded helmet occurs on the seal of King
John (woodcut <a href="#i_255.jpg">52</a>); in our engraving, No. <a href="#i_257.jpg">53</a>, from
Harl. MS. 5,102, early in the century; and in Nos. <a href="#i_228.jpg">49</a>
and <a href="#i_314.jpg">74</a>, both monuments of the close of this period. It
appears plentifully in Roy. MS. 20, D. i., and in the
groups of the Painted Chamber. The conical chapel is
seen in our engraving, No. <a href="#i_271.jpg">58</a>; it occurs also in Harl.
MS. 1,527, and in the Painted Chamber and Lives of
the Offas. The Wide-rimmed Helmet is found throughout
this century. An early example appears in our
engraving, No. <a href="#i_232.jpg">50</a>, from Harl.
MS. 4,751. The figure here
given is from Add. MS. 11,639,
fol. 520; of the close of the century.
It represents Goliath, and
the casque is thus painted:
crown, iron-colour; rim and
crest, gold. The book is in
Hebrew, but believed to have
been written in Germany. See
also our woodcut, No. <a href="#i_228.jpg">49</a>, from
Add. MS. 15,268; and Hefner's
Plate <span class="smcap">v</span>.; and the pictures of the
Painted Chamber. A good example
in sculpture occurs in the
arcade of the north aisle of the
Lady Chapel at Worcester Cathedral.
On Cotton Roll, <span class="smcap">xv</span>. 7,
a variety of this headpiece has
an upright spike at the top. In the ArchÃ¦ological
Journal, vol. viii. p. 319, is engraved a knightly effigy
in which the wide and pointed iron-hat is worn over a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
close skull-cap of plate, to which, is joined a coif of chain-mail.
The Nasal Helmet is found of three varieties:
the cylindrical, the round-topped, and the conical. The
first occurs on the monumental effigy of Raoul De Beaumont,
in the abbey of Estival, founded by him in 1210.
(Kerrich Collections, Add. MS. 6,728.) The hemispherical
appears in the Lives of the Offas and the
Painted Chamber, and on Plate <span class="smcap">xxxiii</span>. of
Hefner. The pointed crown is found
among the subjects of the Painted Chamber,
of which the following is an example.
See also our woodcut, No. <a href="#i_340.jpg">82</a>.</p>

   <p class="caption3">No. 76.</p>
</div>

<p>Besides the above, which are the usual types of casque
found in the thirteenth century, there are some varieties
of occasional appearance. Among these may be mentioned
the open-faced helmet of the Temple effigy figured
by Stothard, Pl. <span class="smcap">xv</span>. In this curious example, all the
head above the neck is cased in a defence of some rigid
material (metal or cuir-bouilli?), and encircled by a band
or turban. Another singular headpiece occurs on folio 7
of the Lives of the Offas (woodcut, No. <a href="#i_330.jpg">80</a>); where the
coif of banded-mail is covered in front with a plate, perforated
for vision and breathing, and strengthened with
the cross-bands already seen in the knightly heaume.
Helmets formed of a framework of metal covering a cap
of leather, similar to the defence noticed at an earlier
period (see page <a href="#Page_69">69</a>), seem to have been in use during this
century. Hefner has figured the metal portion of a real
one found in the island of Negropont, which he assigns to
this period (<i>Trachten</i>, Pl. <span class="smcap">lxiii</span>.) It closely resembles the
bronze example discovered at Leckhampton (woodcut <a href="#i_096.jpg">18</a>),
consisting of a hoop from which spring two arcs of metal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
crossing at the crown. Of similar mixed materials appear
to be those helmets seen in the groups of the Painted
Chamber, where a frame of gold-colour encloses a cap of
crimson or purple (Plates <span class="smcap">xxxv</span>. and <span class="smcap">xxxvi</span>.). And compare
our woodcut, No. <a href="#i_340.jpg">82</a>, also from the Painted Chamber,
in which the frame of the headpiece is of iron-colour,
while the enclosed portion is painted yellow.</p>

<p>The Bassinet and CervelliÃ¨re are named in documents
of this time, but do not appear to have been anything
more than the round-topped skull-cap already noticed.</p>

<p>The bassinet is mentioned in the will of Odo de Rossilion
in 1298, cited by Ducange<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>; a monument further
curious from its giving us the detail of a knight's equipment
in these days:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Idem do et lego domino Petro de Monte Ancelini predicto centum

ensem."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Bassinet with camail <i>attached</i> is not a characteristic
of this century, though isolated examples may
perhaps be found. The knightly effigy at Ashington,
Somersetshire, already noticed, seems to be one of these:
the mail-coif being fixed to the plate-cap by rivets.
(ArchÃ¦ol. Journ., vol. viii. p. 319.) It will be remarked
in that very valuable monument, the Pictures of the
Painted Chamber, that the skull-caps of plate are in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
many instances so placed on the coif-de-mailles as to
shew very clearly that the two defences are quite distinct.</p>

<p>Guiart, in the <i>Chronique MÃ©trique</i>, frequently uses the
name <i>cervelliÃ¨re</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<p>An amusing tale is told in the <i>Chronicon Nonantulanum</i>,
of the invention of the cervelliÃ¨re by Michael Scot,
"Astrologus Friderici Imperatoris familiaris." Having
foreseen that he should meet his death from the fall of a
stone of two ounces weight upon his head, he contrived
a cap (<i>infulam</i>) of plate-iron. But being at mass one day,
at the exaltation of the host, he reverently lifted his cap,
when a little stone fell upon his head, and inflicted a
slight wound. Weighing the stone, he found it to be
exactly two ounces; and then, knowing his doom to be
sealed, he arranged his worldly affairs and died.</p>

<p>From the manuscript collection of "Proverbes" of the
thirteenth century, preserved in the Imperial Library at
Paris, and cited by Le Grand d'Aussy in the <i>Vie privÃ©e
des FranÃ§ois</i><a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>, we learn that the "Heaumes de Poitiers"
had obtained the highest meed of approbation.</p>

<p>The ordinary <span class="smcap">Shield</span> of this period was the triangular:
its dimensions decreasing as the century advanced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
It was bowed or flat. Other targets of this time are the
kite-shaped, the pear-shaped, the heart-shaped, the round,
the quadrangular, and a shield angular at the top and
rounded below.</p>

<p>The triangular, bowed shield appears in our engravings,
Nos. <a href="#i_255.jpg">52</a>, <a href="#i_257.jpg">53</a>, <a href="#i_270.jpg">57</a> and <a href="#i_373.jpg">87</a>; all early examples. Later
instances occur in the seal of Edward I. (No. <a href="#i_366.jpg">85</a>), and our
woodcut, No. <a href="#i_317.jpg">75</a>, from Add. MS. 11,639. The flat triangular
shield is found in the very curious figure on folio
27 of Harl. MS. 3,244, <i>circa</i> 1250; in the brass of Sir
John D'Aubernoun, 1277 (woodcut, No. <a href="#i_264.jpg">55</a>); in the
glass-painting at Oxford Cathedral (woodcut, No. <a href="#i_323.jpg">77</a>);
and in the effigy of Le Botiler (woodcut, No. <a href="#i_314.jpg">74</a>): the
last two monuments, of the close of the century. See
also Painted Chamber, Plate <span class="smcap">xxxvi</span>. It will be observed
that the shield of D'Aubernoun is curiously small. Those
of Crouchback and William de Valence on their tombs
are scarcely larger. (Stothard, Pl. <span class="smcap">xliii</span>. and <span class="smcap">xliv</span>.) The
Kite-shaped shield appears very frequently in Roy. MS.
20, D. i.; a subject from which, with this form of target,
is given in our woodcut, No. <a href="#i_310.jpg">72</a>. It occurs also in Harl.
MS. 1,527, and on Plate <span class="smcap">xxxvi</span>. of the Painted Chamber.
This form, like the foregoing, is sometimes bowed and
sometimes flat. The Pear-shaped variety is found on the
seal of Saer de Quinci, 1210&mdash;19, engraved in Laing's
Ancient Scottish Seals, Pl. <span class="smcap">xi</span>.; and on that of John de
Methkil, c. 1220 (Laing, Pl. <span class="smcap">vii</span>. fig. 3). Another Scottish
seal gives us the Heart-shaped shield, a rare and
early example (Laing, Pl. <span class="smcap">x</span>. fig. 11). The Round target
supported by its guige appears in a group of fighters
in Harl. MS. 1,527; again in the Malvern effigy (Stothard,
Pl. <span class="smcap">xix</span>.); in the Lives of the Offas; and among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
the pictures of the Painted Chamber. The quadrangular
bowed shield is figured in our woodcut, No. <a href="#i_402.jpg">88</a>, from a
Tower Roll, commemorating a wager of battle in the
reign of Henry III. The shield made angular at top
and rounded below may be found on Plate <span class="smcap">xxxi</span>. of the
Painted Chamber, and occurs again on the seal of a
Melros charter of 1285, engraved on page 30 of Laing's
Scottish Seals. It is scarcely necessary to say that the
types which we have endeavoured to distinguish will be
found somewhat varied in particular examples: to describe
every modification of the general forms we have
detected, would be a tedious and a useless task.</p>

<p>The Boss is still retained in some of the shields of this
time, though but rarely. It appears in our woodcuts,
Nos. <a href="#i_317.jpg">75</a> and <a href="#i_402.jpg">88</a>, and on folio 4 of the Lives of the Offas.
The Enarmes, or straps by which the knight sustained
his shield in combat, are well shewn in the effigy of De
Shurland (Stothard, Pl. <span class="smcap">xli</span>.), and receive some further
illustration from the statues of De Vere at Hatfield
Broadoak, Essex, and of Brian Fitz Alan at Bedale,
Yorkshire. Compare also folio 4 of the Lives of the
Offas, and Plate <span class="smcap">xxxviii</span>. of the Painted Chamber. The
Guige, or strap by which the shield was hung round the
neck, is a usual adjunct to this defence during the whole
of the century, and is sometimes of a highly enriched
character. Many of our woodcuts shew the manner of
its use.</p>

<p>From a passage of "The Ancren Riwle," lately printed
by the Camden Society, from a MS. of the thirteenth century,
we learn that the materials of the shield at this time
were "wood, leather, and painting." (p. 393.) These
ingredients frequently reappear in the real targets of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
later time which have been saved from the destruction
of passing centuries.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <p class="caption3">No. 77.</p>
</div>

<p>Armorial bearings are the usual adornment of the
knightly shield throughout this period; and the field
was sometimes richly diapered, as in this example from
the window of the north transept of Oxford Cathedral.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
Compare the monument of De Vere at Hatfield (Stothard,
Pl. <span class="smcap">xxxvi</span>.) Where heraldic devices are not found, a
"pattern" generally takes their place: a cross, a rosette,
a star, a fret, or some such simple ornament. In other
cases the face of the shield is painted of a single colour.
In the effigies placed over the tombs of the knights, the
shield is usually represented as borne on the arm. The
figure of William de Valence in Westminster Abbey has
it slung at the hip; an arrangement frequently adopted
in French monuments, and occasionally in those of other
continental countries.</p>

<p>Another continental custom sometimes imitated by
our own countrymen, was that of adorning the walls of
the banqueting-hall on great occasions with the shields
of distinguished heroes. When, in 1254, the English
king entertained the French monarch in the Temple in
Paris, "the banquet was given," says Matthew Paris,
"in the great hall of the Temple, in which were hung
up, according to the <i>continental custom</i>, as many bucklers
as the four walls could hold." Amongst others was seen
the shield of Richard, king of England, concerning which
a witty person present said to King Henry, "Why, my
Lord, have you invited the French to dine with you in
this house? See, there is the shield of the noble-hearted
English king, Richard! your guests will be unable to
eat without fear and trembling<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>."</p>

<p>From the curious volume already cited, the <i>Ancren
Rule</i>, we learn that at the demise of a brave knight, his
shield was hung aloft on the church walls, in honour and
remembrance of his valorous deeds.</p>

<p>The Spur of this century is of three kinds: the simple
goad, the ball-and-spike, and the rowel. The goad is
sometimes straight, sometimes curved. The straight
spike is seen in this example of an iron spur found in
the churchyard of Chesterford, Cambridgeshire, and now
preserved in the collection of the Hon. Richard Neville.
Compare our engravings, Nos. <a href="#i_271.jpg">58</a> and <a href="#i_366.jpg">85</a>. The curved
goad appears in woodcuts <a href="#i_264.jpg">55</a> and <a href="#i_312.jpg">73</a>. Our engravings,
Nos. <a href="#i_281.jpg">62</a>, <a href="#i_310.jpg">72</a> and <a href="#i_334.jpg">81</a> shew the ball-and-spike kind; of
which we have already seen examples in the statues of
Henry II. and Richard I. at Fontevraud. The rowel
spur is found but in one or two instances during this
century. It is represented on the seal of Henry III.,
here given; where, in order to bring up the rowel to
the middle of the heel, the seal-engraver has resorted to
the singular expedient of raising the field into a sort
of hillock, on the top of which he has sculptured the
star-like rowel. See Harleian Charter, 43, C. 38. The
rowel spur again appears on the effigy of Le Botiler
(woodcut, No. <a href="#i_314.jpg">74</a>). It is, however, rather a characteristic
of the fourteenth than of this century; and, generally
speaking, its presence alone should lead one to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
hesitate long before assigning a monument to the earlier
period, even though it should exhibit all the other features
of the more ancient costume. The monument of
Johan Le Botiler, just named, is by no means exempt
from the operation of this rule.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <p class="caption2">GREAT SEAL OF KING HENRY III.</p>
   <p class="caption3">No. 79.</p>
</div>

<p>The shank of the spur is curved, each end being
formed into a loop to receive the strap. The strap itself
is single, buckling over the instep. See Stothard's Plates
<span class="smcap">xvii</span>. and <span class="smcap">xxii</span>. Some exceptions occur to this usual
arrangement. In the effigy of a De L'Isle, figured by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
Stothard, Plate <span class="smcap">xx</span>., the outer shank is flattened into a
trefoil and rivetted upon the leather. In the figure at
Norton, Durham, (woodcut, No. <a href="#i_302.jpg">70</a>,) the shanks terminate
in rings, and two straps are employed to fix the
spur to the foot. Both straps and spurs are occasionally
shewn of an enriched character. On folio 27 of Harl.
MS. 3,244, the spur is ornamented with a row of studs
or bosses. In the brass at Acton, Suffolk, 1302 (Waller,
Pt. ii.), the pattern consists of rosettes.</p>

<p>The gilded spurs of the knights occasionally became
the trophy of a victory; as in the case of the battle of
Courtray, in 1302. More than five hundred pairs, Froissart
tells us, were suspended in a chapel of the church
of Our Lady of Courtray: "Et ces Ã©perons avoient jadis
Ã©tÃ© des seigneurs de France, qui avoient Ã©tÃ© morts en
la dite bataille; et en faisoient ceux de Courtray tous
les ans, pour le triomphe, trÃ¨s grand solemnitÃ©<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>."</p>

<p>The Beard during this century appears to have been
usually worn by the aged only. The young knight has
commonly neither beard nor moustache: indeed, this imberbed
state of the Western cavaliers is made a reproach
to them by the Saracens. The Sultan, we are told by
Matthew Paris, under 1250, addressing his chiefs, in arms
against the forces of St. Louis, exclaimed: "What rash
madness excites these men to attack us and endeavour
to deprive us of our inheritance, who have inhabited this
noble country since the Flood? A certain motive, however
slight, urges the Christians to covet the land which
they call Holy: but what have they to do with Egypt?
Unfit indeed are they to lord it over a land which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
watered and enriched by the river sent from Paradise:
beardless, shorn men, unwarlike and imbecile, more like
women than men, what rash daring is this<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>!"</p>

<p>For the arrangement of the beard of this time, see the
effigies of King John and Henry III. (Stothard, Plates
<span class="smcap">xi</span>. and <span class="smcap">xxxi</span>.), and Plate <span class="smcap">xxxix</span>. of the Painted Chamber.</p>

<p>The fashion of the Hair differs considerably in the first
and second portions of the century. In both it was cut
short at the forehead: but in the first half it was allowed
to fall in its natural flow to some length at the sides of
the head and behind; while, in the second, it was most
carefully arranged in large curls, which cover the ears,
and give a strongly marked character to the monuments
of this time. In the effigy of King John at Worcester,
the side hair is cut sheer off just below the ear. In the
figure of Prince John, the son of St. Louis, in the Abbey
Church of St. Denis, the hair falls in a natural ringlet to
the neck<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>. The large and formal curl of the later period
is well shewn in the knightly sculpture from Norton
Church, Durham (woodcut, No. <a href="#i_302.jpg">70</a>). See also the statue
of Henry III. (Stothard, Pl. <span class="smcap">xxxi</span>.), and the series of
monumental figures sculptured in 1263-4 by order of
St. Louis, to perpetuate the memory of his ancestors
entombed at St. Denis. (Guilhermy, pp. 218, 223, 225
and 228.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Spear</span> for war of the thirteenth century offers no
change from that of the preceding age. The shaft of it
is still uniform from end to end, not yet being hollowed
out for the grip, as in the lance of a later date. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
head is of three forms: the lozenge, the leaf, and the
barbed. The lozenge spear-head is the most usual, and
appears in the accompanying group from the Lives of the
Two Offas, Cott. MS., Nero, D. i. fol. 7. See also our
woodcuts, No. <a href="#i_281.jpg">62</a> and <a href="#i_317.jpg">75</a>. The leaf-shaped head occurs on
fol. 4 of Nero, D. i.; on fol. 27 of Harl. MS. 3,244; and
on the Shurland monument (Stothard, Pl. <span class="smcap">xli</span>.) The
barbed spear was probably not considered a knightly
weapon, but carried by soldiers of an inferior grade. At
all events, we occasionally find men-at-arms furnished
with it, as in Roy. MS. 20, D. i., a book of about the close
of this century. And earlier in the period, at the battle of
Bovines in 1214, we have the curious account of Rigord,
shewing the jeopardy in which the life of King Philip
was placed through the attack of a soldier armed with a
spear of this description. This soldier of the emperor's
host struck at the neck of the king, the usual point of
attack, and though the gorget of the monarch prevented
the weapon from inflicting any wound, the barbs of the
spear became so firmly fixed between the hauberk and
the head-defence, that the sturdy German was enabled
to pull Philippe Auguste from his horse and lay him
prone at his feet. The king managed to raise himself
again, but the soldier held firm. The emperor, who was
near at hand, rushed forward to terminate the strife by
the death of his rival, and all seemed over. Galon de
Montigny meanwhile, the Bannerer of the king, proclaimed
the danger of his master by incessantly <i>raising
and lowering</i> the Standard over the spot where this contest
was taking place. The French were animated to
new exertions: a band of seigneurs and gentlemen cut
their way to the spot where the king was struggling in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a><br /><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a><br /><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
unequal conflict with his foes: the spearman, struck down
or slain, let go his hold: the fight continued, furiously
as ever, but in numbers less disproportionate than before:
Etienne de Longchamp, one of the bravest of the French
nobles, is slain by the side of the king: Pierre Tristan,
another distinguished knight, leaps from his steed, and
gives it to his monarch: Guillaume des Barres at this
moment comes up with reinforcements, charges the German
host with impetuous bravery, and turns their triumph
into a rout.</p>

<p>The Lance is occasionally furnished with a streamer,
as at a former period. It is seen in our last engraving
(No. <a href="#i_330.jpg">80</a>), from the Lives of the Offas; and again in
woodcuts, Nos. <a href="#i_264.jpg">55</a> and <a href="#i_281.jpg">62</a>. Compare also Harl. MS.
3,244, fol. 27, and other groups from the Lives of the
Offas. In some of these examples, the lance-flag is ensigned
with a cross only; in others it is quite blank: in
others, again, as the brass of D'Aubernoun, it bears a
device clearly heraldic.</p>

<p>In a few rare instances the spear is represented on the
tomb of the knight. The necessity of reducing it far
beneath its legitimate proportions, in order to be comprised
within the narrow limits of the sepulchral memorial,
would furnish a sufficient reason for its being generally
excluded from the monumental design: but it is
not improbable that mere fashion (for the tomb has its
fashions) contributed in some degree to this exclusion;
because we find that the royal and knightly seals, which
at a previous date constantly exhibited the lance with
its streamer, now more usually represent the warrior
armed with the sword. The lance is found on the brass
of D'Aubernoun (woodcut, No. <a href="#i_264.jpg">55</a>), on the sculptured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
effigy of a knight in the churchyard of Ruabon, in
Wales, and in the incised slab at Ashington, Somersetshire,
figured in the ArchÃ¦ological Journal, vol. viii.
p. 319.</p>

<p>For the hastilude, the spear-head was blunted, and
"about the breadth of a small knife;" as we learn from
Matthew Paris, in his account of the Round-Table Game
held at the Abbey of Wallenden in 1252. Here, one of
the knights, Roger de Lemburn, aimed his weapon, the
point of which was not blunted as it ought to have been,
in such a way that it entered under the helm of his adversary,
Arnold de Montigny, and pierced his throat;
for he was uncovered in that part, and without a collar
(<i>carens collario</i>). The Earl of Gloucester with the other
knights immediately sought to extract the fragment of
the lance, and when he had succeeded in withdrawing the
wooden shaft of it, the iron head remained behind: on
this being at length extracted, and examined by the surrounding
knights, it was found to be very sharp at the
point, like a dagger; though it ought to have been
blunt, and about as broad as a small knife. Its shape
was like that of a ploughshare on a small scale, whence
it was commonly called a little plough (<i>vomerulus</i>), and in
French, <i>soket</i><a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>. We have here the description of two
spear-heads very distinct in character: one rebated for
the Jousts of Peace, seemingly the prototype of the coronel
which afterwards replaced it; and the other a sharp
instrument, the form of which we may perhaps recognise
among the tilting weapons of the <i>Triumph of Maximilian</i>.
See, for instance, the group of knights armed for the
"Course appelÃ©e Bund."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>
<p>When, in battle, the charge had been made with the
Lance, and that weapon was no longer available in the
<i>mÃªlÃ©e</i>, it was cast aside, and the conquest carried on
with the Sword:&mdash;</p>

   <p class="caption2">SECOND GREAT SEAL OF KING HENRY III.</p>
   <p class="caption3">No. 81.</p>
</div>

<p>The knightly <span class="smcap">Sword</span> of this day resembled in its essentials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
that of the preceding century: indeed, it did not
materially change during the whole Gothic period. The
blade was straight, broad, double-edged, and pointed.
The type is well shewn in the second seal of Henry III.
(woodcut, No. <a href="#i_334.jpg">81</a>).</p>

<p>The cross-piece was usually curved towards the blade,
as represented in several of our engravings. Sometimes
this curved guard threw out a kind of cusp in the
middle, as in the sculpture at Haseley, (woodcut <a href="#i_219.jpg">46</a>,)
and the effigy figured by Stothard, Plate <span class="smcap">xx</span>. The cross-bar
was at other times straight, as in the seal of King
John (woodcut, No. <a href="#i_255.jpg">52</a>), and in our other woodcuts numbered
<a href="#i_257.jpg">53</a>, <a href="#i_265.jpg">56</a>, and <a href="#i_284.jpg">63</a>. Compare the sword of De Vere
(Stothard, Pl. <span class="smcap">xxxvi</span>.). A variety of the straight guard
forms also a cusp over the centre of the blade, as in the
example given in our engraving, No. <a href="#i_330.jpg">80</a>. The knightly
effigy in Walkerne Church (Hollis, Pt. i.) has a sword-guard
in the form of a chevron. Edward I., on his
great seal, (woodcut, No. <a href="#i_366.jpg">85</a>,) offers us a further variety,
in which the outline somewhat resembles that of the
Greek bow.</p>

<p>The pommel of the sword during this century takes
many forms: the round, the trefoil, the cinquefoil, the
rosette, the lozenge, the conical, the pear-shaped, the
square, and the fleur-de-lis. The round is either plain
or ornamented on its sides: in the latter case the ornament
is usually a cross, or a shield of arms. The plain
round pommel is generally wheel-formed; that is, it has
a projection in the centre something like the nave of a
wheel. See Journal of ArchÃ¦ological Association, vol. i.
p. 336. The sacred symbol of the Cross is very frequently
found on the circular pommel; as in our woodcuts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
No. <a href="#i_264.jpg">55</a> and <a href="#i_323.jpg">77</a>. The shield of arms appears in our
engraving, No. <a href="#i_302.jpg">70</a>. Compare the Fitz-Alan monument
(Hollis, Pt. iv.). The trefoil pommel is represented in
our cuts, No. <a href="#i_265.jpg">56</a> and <a href="#i_314.jpg">74</a>; the cinquefoil, on our engraving,
No. <a href="#i_288.jpg">64</a>, and in Plate <span class="smcap">xx</span>. of Stothard's Monuments.
The rose form occurs in our woodcut, No. <a href="#i_281.jpg">62</a>;
the lozenge on the effigy of King John (Stothard, Pl.
<span class="smcap">xi</span>.); the conical, in our print, No. <a href="#i_284.jpg">63</a>; the pear-shaped,
in Stothard's 37th Plate; the square, on Plate <span class="smcap">xxxv</span>. of
the Painted Chamber; and the fleur-de-lis on the seal
of Edward I. (woodcut, No. <a href="#i_366.jpg">85</a>).</p>

<p>The sword-handle is sometimes of a highly enriched
character. That of King John, on his monument in
Worcester Cathedral, represents a weapon in which both
pommel and cross-bar were inlaid with precious stones.
Ornamental grips are seen in the monument of Crouchback
(Stothard, Pl. <span class="smcap">xliii</span>. fig. 4), and the brass of De
Bures, 1302 (Waller, Pt. ii.).</p>

<p>The Sheath also occasionally exhibits enrichments.
These are either metal harnessings, of Gothic patterns,
similar to the architectural designs of the day, as in our
woodcut, No. <a href="#i_302.jpg">70</a>, and the effigy of Brian, lord Fitz-Alan
(Hollis, Pt. iv.); or the scabbard is embellished from end
to end with a series of shields of arms, as in our engraving,
No. <a href="#i_312.jpg">73</a>, and the statue of De Montfort (Stothard,
Pl. <span class="smcap">xxxix</span>.). These escutcheons were probably tinctured
by means of enamel.</p>

<p>The characteristic Sword-Belt of this century consisted
of two straps, a long and a short one. The long strap
was looped to the scabbard about two hands-breadths
from the top, passed round the waist, and fastened to the
buckle in front, leaving a long end tipped with a metal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
tag. The short strap held the buckle, and was split into
two thongs, one of which was laced into the top of the
(leather) scabbard; the other, passing obliquely across
the sheath, being laced into the loop of the long strap
below. See our woodcuts, Nos. <a href="#i_264.jpg">55</a> and <a href="#i_312.jpg">73</a>. A variety
of this mode consisted in attaching the long and short
straps to the scabbard by ring-lockets of metal, in lieu
of the loop and lacings. This occurs late in the century.
See woodcut, No. <a href="#i_302.jpg">70</a>, and the effigy of Brian Fitz-Alan
(Hollis, Pt. iv.). The common sword-belt of the soldiery
was formed on the old plan: at one end of a broad strap
were two clefts, through which the two thongs into
which the other end was split were passed and tied into
a knot. See woodcut, No. <a href="#i_284.jpg">63</a>. The figures there given
represent the soldiers of Herod engaged in the Massacre
of the Innocents. The knightly sword-belt is often
highly enriched; being covered with elaborate patterns,
worked in the most brilliant colours, and harnessed with
bars and bosses of gilt metal, or perhaps of gold itself;
the bosses, towards the end of the period, taking not unfrequently
the form of lions' heads. The ornament of
bars only, appears on a Temple Church effigy, figured by
Hollis, Pt. i.; of bars and rosettes, in Stothard's 15th
and 45th Plates; of a painted pattern, in Plate <span class="smcap">xxi</span>. of
Stothard's work; of bosses in the form of lions' heads, in
Part iv. of Hollis. The sword-belt of Edmund Crouchback
is enriched with heraldic bearings. See Stothard,
Pl. <span class="smcap">xliii</span>. detail 1.</p>

<p>Minute variations from the above types of Sword-belt
may be found, but do not seem to require a particular
description. We must not omit to remark, however,
that, in some early monuments of this period, the sword<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
is represented as worn at the right side of the warrior.
Three effigies in the Temple Church, London, exhibit
this arrangement.</p>

<p>At York, on Christmas-day, 1252, King Henry III.
conferred knighthood on the young king of Scotland;
who, the day following, espoused the Princess Margaret,
daughter of Henry, amidst great rejoicings and a
splendid ceremonial. To obtain a detailed description
of the Sword used by the king of England on this occasion
was scarcely within the hope of the archÃ¦ologist;
but, singularly enough, such an account, of curious minuteness,
has come down to us. It is preserved in the
Tower, (Close Rolls, 36 H. III. m. 31,) and has been
Printed in Walpole's "Painting in England" (vol. i.
chap. 1):&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mandatum est Edwardo de Westm. quod cum festinatione

<p>Besides the ordinary knightly sword of the thirteenth
century, the size of which is authenticated by many existing
monuments, we have the evidence of cotemporary
writers that swords of differing sizes were employed by
different nations. The Germans affected a large brand,
the French a shorter weapon. Thus Guiart:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the description of the Battle of Benevento, in 1266,
Hugues de BauÃ§oi, an eye-witness of the conflict, tells
us that the troops of Manfred, Germans and Saracens,
fought with long swords, axes and maces; but the
French, coming to close quarters, pierced them with
their short swords: "ex brevibus spathis suis eorum
latera perfodiebant<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>." Guillaume de Nangis gives similar
testimony<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>. How far these German weapons approached
the great two-hand swords of later times, or the French
reverted to the short blade of the Romans, it is vain to
inquire. Commentators have seen in the above descriptions
both the types here named; but the evidence of
pictorial monuments does not confirm the conclusion.
As large and small are but comparative terms, it is
probable that the swords of the French and Germans
differed in no great degree.</p>

<p>Other varieties of Sword which appear in the thirteenth
century are the Falchion, the curved Sabre, the
EspÃ©e Ã  l'estoc, the Cultellus, and the Anelace.</p>

<p>The Falchion (<i>fauchon</i>, Fr., from the Latin <i>falx</i>) is
of two kinds: the first a broad blade, becoming wider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
towards the point, the edge convex, the back concave;
as in this example from the Painted Chamber:</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="i_340.jpg" id="i_340.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/i_340.jpg" alt="No. 82." title="No. 82." />
   <p class="caption3">No. 82.</p>
</div>

<p>the other differing from it only in having the back quite
straight. The latter is figured on Plate <span class="smcap">xxxi</span>. of the
Painted Chamber; and of this form is the curious tenure
sword of the lordship of Sockburn, co. Durham, engraved
in the ArchÃ¦ologia, vol. xv. Plate <span class="smcap">xxvi</span>. See, in Blount's
"Antient Tenures," an account of this weapon; of the
"monstrous Dragon, Worm, or flying Serpent, that devoured
Men, Women, and Children," which fell at last
under its keen edge; and of the "tomb of the great
Ancestor of the Conyers, having carvings of the falchion,
and of a dog, and of the monstrous Worm or Serpent,
lying at the Knight's feet, of his own killing, of which
the History of the Family gives the above account."
The passage is too long for extract<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>
<p>The falchion is a weapon of very remote antiquity.
It appears among the paintings on the tomb at Thebes
of Rameses III., <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1230. See Plate <span class="smcap">iii</span>. of Wilkinson's
"Ancient Egyptians" (ed. 1837). And it is found,
almost identical in shape, in the wall-paintings of the
Ajunta Caves, of the first century of the Christian era;
of which a careful copy has been made for the Museum
of the East India House. Guiart often mentions it in
the <i>Chronique MÃ©trique</i>, as in this passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<span class="i1">Si merveilleus que les plus cointes<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>The curved Sabre is of very rare appearance. It
occurs among the pictures of the Painted Chamber,
Plate <span class="smcap">xxxv</span>.</p>

<p>The EpÃ©e Ã  l'estoc (Stabbing Sword) is named in a
judgment of the Parliament of Paris in 1268: "Sufficienter
inventum est quod dictus Boso dictum Ademarum
percussit cum Ense a estoc in dextro latero propria manu,
et de ipso ictu cecidit dictus Ademarus." It appears
also to be the weapon which Rigord assigns to some of
the imperial troops at the battle of Bovines: "Habebant
cultellos longos, graciles, triacumines, quolibet acumine
indifferenter secantes, a cuspide usque ad manubrium,
quibus utebantur pro gladiis."</p>

<p>The Cultellus, as we have seen<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>, was a weapon partaking
of the character of the sword and the dagger. It
clearly varied in size; for Odo de Rossilion, in 1298,
names in his will "meum magnum cultellum et meam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
parvam ensem." Being the chief arm of the coustillers,
it must have been of some considerable size: and of this
larger kind must also have been the weapon assigned, in
the "Outillement du villain," to the peasant, for the defence
of his home:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Si le convient armer<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Arc e lance enfumÃ©e," &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In other places, it appears as a mere secondary arm,
a knife or dagger; as in the Statutes of Arms already
cited, where the various classes of proprietors are directed
to have "espe, cutel e cheval," or "espe e cutel,"
or "espes, arcs, setes e cutel."</p>

<p>The particular construction of the Anelace, as well
as the derivation of its name, has hitherto eluded
the most careful examination of antiquaries and glossarists.
Some have referred the name to the Latin or
Italian, <i>annulus</i>, or <i>annello</i>. Others to the Old-German,
<i>Laz</i>, from <i>latus</i>; the weapon being therefore a "side-arm."
Matthew Paris often uses the word, and tells us
that the arm was worn at the girdle: "LoricÃ¢ erat indutus,
gestans anelacium ad lumbare." Without hoping
to settle this question, we may venture to point out that
a weapon of the dagger kind, carried at the belt, and
having a chain with <i>a ring running loosely upon the grip</i>,
to prevent its being lost in the <i>mÃªlÃ©e</i>, was certainly in
use during the middle-ages; an example of which may
be seen in the effigy of William Wenemaer, at Ghent,
dated 1325; engraved in the ArchÃ¦ological Journal, vol.
vii. p. 287. We may note also that the wheel-like form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
of the <i>guard</i> may have supplied the name; for Florio, in
the sixteenth century, defines "Annelle" to be "thin
plates of iron made like rings, called of our gunners
washers," &amp;c. Guiart also mentions the anelace: under
the year 1298, he has:&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>In the manufacture of Swords at this period, Cologne
seems to have had the palm. The volume of Proverbs
already noticed gives the highest place to the "Espees
de Cologne." And Matthew Paris, under 1241<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>, relating
how certain wicked German Jews, wishing to assist the
Tartars, sent them certain barrels, (filled, as they told
the Christians, with poisoned wine,) adds that, on the
toll-man suspiciously scrutinizing the contents, "all the
casks were found to be filled with Cologne swords and
daggers, without hilts, closely and compactly stowed
away. The Jews were, therefore, at once handed over
to the executioners, to be either consigned to perpetual
imprisonment, or to be slain with their own swords."</p>

<p>The Exercise of the Sword and Buckler (<i>Eskirmye de
Bokyler</i>) was in vogue in this century, and schools were
established for teaching it. But disorders arising from
the practice, the schools were ordered to be closed. Thus
the "Statuta Civitatis London" of the 13 Edw. I. has:
"Primerement pur ceo qe multz des mals com des murdres
robberyes e homycides ont este fetz ca en arrere deinz
la Citee de nuyt e de jour, e gentz batues e mal tretes e
autres diverses aventures de mal avenuz encontre sa pes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>

<p>Representations of the Sword-and-buckler contest occur
in Roy. MSS. 14, E. iii. and 20, D. vi., both engraved in
Strutt's Sports. See also Hefner, Pt. ii. Plate <span class="smcap">vii</span>. All
these, however, are miniatures
of the fourteenth century;
though 14, E. iii. is
early in the period. From
these examples we learn that
the buckler was about a foot
and a half in diameter, had
a boss in the centre, and
was held at arm's length by
a bar crossing the hollow of
the umbo, exactly in the
manner of the Anglo-Saxon
shields described and figured
in a former page. (See woodcut,
No. <a href="#i_102.jpg">20</a>.)</p>

<p>Occasionally the figure
of a Sword was carved on
the tomb of the knight,
to indicate his calling, as in this incised slab from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
Brougham Church, Westmoreland, commemorating one of
the Brougham family. The example is further curious
from its including also the round shield of the period;
differing, as we see, from the buckler named above, in
having no boss. The sword is usually, on tombs of this
kind, accompanied by a Cross: sometimes it forms itself the
cross on the monument, as in the Gorforth memorial, engraved
on page 84 of Mr. Boutell's work on Incised Slabs.
At Aycliffe, Durham, is a tomb on which appears a cross,
having on one side a sword, on the other a hammer and
pincers. This group of emblems has been thought to
indicate a weapon-smith. The monument is figured in
the ArchÃ¦ological Journal, vol. v. p. 257. Not the
sword only, but the spear, the axe, the dagger, and
other weapons, are found on the incised slabs of the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries; many examples of
which may be seen in the works on these memorials by
the Rev. Mr. Cutts and the Rev. Mr. Boutell.</p>

<p>The Dagger by no means filled that prominent place
in the knightly equipment during this century which it
is found to occupy in the fourteenth; though, towards
the close of the period, it is seen to be coming into
vogue. It is worn by the knights represented in our
engravings, Nos. <a href="#i_271.jpg">58</a> and <a href="#i_310.jpg">72</a>; and the Ash Church effigy
(woodcut, No. <a href="#i_274.jpg">59</a>) shews us the lace by which the dagger,
now destroyed, was fastened to the waist-belt. The figure
of De Montford (Stothard, Pl. <span class="smcap">xxxix</span>.) has the dagger.
It appears also in the Shurland monument (Stothard,
Pl. <span class="smcap">xli</span>.), worn by the knight's attendant; and in this
example the guard of it is formed of two knobs, a
fashion occasionally found up to the sixteenth century.
In Durham Cathedral is preserved a real dagger, which
is believed to have belonged to one of the retainers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
Bishop Anthony in 1283. It is entirely of iron, and the
blade, which is sixteen inches in length, is inscribed
"<span class="smcap">Anton: Eps: Dunolm.</span><a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>"</p>

<p>Under the name of <i>Misericordia</i>, the dagger has an
early mention in the Charter of Arras, in 1221: "Quicumque
cultellum cum cuspide, vel curtam sphatulam,
vel misericordiam, vel aliqua arma multritoria portaverit,"
&amp;c. Under 1302, Guiart speaks of it by the
same name:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Plusieurs piÃ©tons FranÃ§ois ala,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Qui pour prisonniers n'ont pas cordes,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Mais coutiaux et misericordes,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Dont on doit servir en tiex festes."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And under 1303:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Fauchons trenchans, espÃ©es cleres,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Godendas, lances Ã©moulues,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Coutiaux, misericordes nues."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This name of misericorde appears to have been given
because, in the last struggle of contending foes, the uplifted
dagger compelled the discomfited fighter to cry
for mercy. In this view, the murderous misericorde
was by the middle-age poets assigned to "Pity," as an
emblem of her benevolence. Thus Jean de MÃ©un in the
Romance of the Rose:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Pitiez, qui Ã  tous bien s'accorde,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Tenoit une Misericorde<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Decourant de plors e de lermes."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Short Axe is very rarely given to the knightly
combatant by the artists of the thirteenth century. It
appears to have been resigned to the less dignified order
of soldiery. The form of the head exhibits three principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
varieties: the single blade, of which we have a
good example in Harl. MS. 4,751, fol. 8 (woodcut, No.
<a href="#i_232.jpg">50</a>); the double weapon, in which one side has a vertical
axe-blade and the other a pick (see Strutt's Dress and
Habits, Pl. <span class="smcap">lxv</span>.); and the double weapon, in which one
side has a horizontal blade and the other a pick (see
Stothard's Monuments, Pl. <span class="smcap">xix</span>.). Guiart, under 1264,
mentions the axe mingling in the strife of battle with
the mace and the sword:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Le chaple commence aus espees,<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>And when, in the same year 1264, the Earl of Leicester
assembled his army on Barham Downs, in addition to
the ordinary military levy, every township was required
to send eight, six, or four footmen well armed with spears,
bows and arrows, swords, cross-bows, and hatchets. (New
Rymer, 444.)</p>

<p>From the collection of thirteenth-century Proverbs,
which has already supplied us with several curious particulars
of this early time, we learn that the "Haches
de Dannemark" held the first place among the axes of
the period: but whether this distinction is accorded for
the form or the manufacture of the weapon, is not
clear. Matthew Paris speaks of it under 1256: "Cum
jaculis&mdash;&mdash;Danisque securibus et gesis<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>&mdash;&mdash;hostiliter insequuntur."</p>

<p>The "Danish Axe" is mentioned in several military
tenures of this century; but a more remote antiquity is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
usually assigned to the origin of the grant itself. The
weapon (more or less original) was always exhibited with
great pride in the family mansion. Dugdale tells us that
Plumpton in Warwickshire "was possest in <i>Henry</i> 3.
time by one <i>Walter de Plompton</i>, who held these lands
by a certain weapon called a <i>Danish Axe</i>: which, being
the very Charter whereby the said land was given unto
one of his Ancestors, hung up for a long time in the
Hall of the capitall messuage belonging thereto, in testimony
of the said tenure; untill that the said House
was seized upon by Sir <i>John Bracebrigge</i>, Knight, Lord
of <span class="smcap">Kingsburie</span> in <i>Edward</i> 3. time, and pulled to the
ground: After which it remained a great while in the
Hall of the mansion belonging to <i>William de Plompton</i>,
in <span class="smcap">Hardreshull</span> (about two miles distant), being commonly
reputed and called <i>the Charter of</i> <span class="smcap">Plomton</span><a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>."</p>

<p>And in the 12th Edw. I.: "Robertus Hurding tenet
unam acram terrae et unum furnum in villa Castri de
Lanceveton (Launceston, co. Cornwall) nomine serjantiae
essendi in Castro de Lanceveton cum uno Capello ferreo
et una Hachet Denesh per <span class="smcap">xl</span>. dies tempore guerrae ad
custum suum proprium, et post <span class="smcap">xl</span>. dies, si Dominus
Castri velit ipsum tenere in eodem Castro, erit ad custus
ipsius domini<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>."</p>

<p>The Mace is both named and pictured in evidences of
this century. Matthew Paris, describing the disasters
of a tournament near Hertford in 1241, adds: "Many
other knights and men-at-arms were also wounded and
seriously injured with maces (<i>clavis</i>) at this same tournament,
because the jealousy of many of those concerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
had converted the sport into a battle<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>." This and similar
mishaps led to the mace, with other weapons, being
interdicted at these pastimes; for in a "Statutum Armorum
ad Torniamenta" of this century, it is ordered by
the king "qe nul Chivaler ne Esquier qe sert al Turney
ne porte espeie a point, ne cotel a point, ne bastoun, ne
mace, fors espee large pur turneer<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>." Pictured examples
of the mace occur in Roy. MS. 20, D. i., ff. 12 and 69;
and on Plate <span class="smcap">xxxiii</span>. of the Painted Chamber. The striking
part is formed in the manner of a cogged wheel: the top
sometimes terminates in a knob; sometimes it is prolonged
into a pike.</p>

<p>The BÃ¢ton named in the above Statute was probably
no more than a stout cudgel. The form of the tournament
bÃ¢ton of a later time is given in full detail in the
"Tournois du roi RenÃ©."</p>

<p>The long-handled weapons of the infantry named in
this century are the Guisarme, the Godendac, the Croc,
the Faus, the Faussar, and the Pilete.</p>

<p>The Guisarme, or Pole-axe, has already been described,
(ante, p. <a href="#Page_50">50</a>). It is named by Matthew Paris: "Gestabant
autem gladios, bipennes, <i>gaesa</i>, sicas et anelacios."
It occurs also in the Statute of Winchester: "E que
ad meyns des chateus de <span class="smcap">xl</span>. soudes, seyt juree as faus,
gysarmes, coteaux e autres menus armes." The Pole-axe
with a single vertical blade is seen in a miniature
of the thirteenth century, inserted into the Gospels of
Mac Durnan in the Lambeth Library (figured in Westwood's
PalÃ¦ographia); and it appears again in the Lives
of the Offas, Cott. MS., Nero, D. i.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>The Godendac was the name given by the Flemings to
the Halbard. Guiart, describing the battle of Courtrai,
in 1302, has this very curious passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A grans batons pesans ferrÃ©s<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Avec leur fer agu devant<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Vont ceux de France recevant<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Tiex baton qu'il portent en guerre<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ont nom Godendac en la terre.<br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Goden-dac</i>, c'est <i>Bon jour</i> Ã  dire,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Qui en Francois le veut dÃ©crire.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Cil baton sont long e traitis,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Pour fÃ©rir a deux mains faitis."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Should the axe-stroke fail, then the skilful halbardier
repairs his mishap with a prompt thrust of the piked
head:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Et quand l'on en faut au descendre,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Si cil qui fiert y veut entendre,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Du bout devant en estoquant<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Son ennemi."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The halbard, consisting of an axe-blade balanced by a
pick, and having a pike-head at the end of the staff, is
figured on Plate <span class="smcap">xxxi</span>. of the Painted Chamber.</p>

<p>The Faus (<i>falso</i>: from <i>falx</i>) appears to have been a
kind of spear with a broad, cut-and-thrust blade. It is
made synonymous with the spear in this passage of the
Synodus Nemausensis, in 1284: (de Clericis) "Enses non
deferant, nec cultellos acutos, nec lanceas <i>seu falsones</i>,"
&amp;c. But in the Statuta Eccles. Cadurcensis, in 1289,
it is distinguished from the spear: "balistas et arcus,
lanceas, falsones, costalarios seu alia arma non deferant."
In the Statute of Winchester, as we have seen, (ante,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
p. <a href="#Page_211">211</a>,) it was placed at the head of the humbler class
of weapons prescribed to the militia of small means.</p>

<p>The Faussar, a kindred word, was probably a kindred
weapon. Like the falso, it most likely presented some
variety in the exemplars turned out from the village
weaponers' smithies. One kind was three-edged, and
had a second name, the Trialemellum. At Bovines,
"Ante oculos ipsius regis occiditur Stephanus de Longo
Campo, in capite percussus longo, gracili Trialemello<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>,
quem Falsarium nominant<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>." The faussar appears to
have been sometimes used as a missile: thus, in the
Chron. de Duguesclin (of the fourteenth century) we
are told that the combatants</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Gettent dars et faussars, moult en vont ociant."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Croc was probably the Bill. It is named by
Guiart among the weapons of the Ribauds in 1214:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Li uns une pilete porte,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">L'autre croc ou macue torte."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The fashion of the Bill of this time, a broad, cutting
blade, forming a beak near the top and terminating in
a pike, may be seen in Plate <span class="smcap">xxxi</span>. of the Painted
Chamber.</p>

<p>The Pilete (dimin. of <i>Pilum</i>) named in the above passage
of Guiart, was a pike, the exact form of which, like
that of so many of the weapons of this period, has not
been ascertained. The "macue torte" is a knotted club.</p>

<p>The missile weapons of this day were the javelin, the
long-bow, the cross-bow, the cord-sling and the staff-sling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p>The Javelin is mentioned by Matthew Paris: "cum
jaculis Danisque securibus et gesis<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>."</p>

<p>The Long-bow has already been noticed in our examination
of the troops of this century. Its form is seen in
our woodcuts, Nos. <a href="#i_222.jpg">47</a>, <a href="#i_226.jpg">48</a>, <a href="#i_228.jpg">49</a> and <a href="#i_232.jpg">50</a>. The fashion of
the Quiver appears in the engraving from Roy. MS. 20,
D. i. (No. <a href="#i_222.jpg">47</a>). The feathering of the arrows is shewn
in the same print; the shaft and head in woodcut, No.
<a href="#i_340.jpg">82</a>, from the Painted Chamber. Besides the ordinary
arrows, shafts armed with phials of quick-lime were occasionally
discharged from the long-bow. Strutt, in his
<i>Horda</i><a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>, has furnished an example of this missile, from
a MS. of Matthew Paris in Benet College, Cambridge
(copied in our woodcut, No. <a href="#i_233.jpg">51</a>); and in the Additamenta
to the printed History of Matthew Paris, page
1091, is given the letter of Sir Guy, a knight of the
household of the Viscount of Melun, in which, recounting
the capture of Damietta, he says: "We discharged
fiery darts (<i>spicula ignita</i>) and stones from our sea mangonels,
and we threw small bottles full of lime (<i>phialas
plenas calce</i>), made to be shot from a bow, or small sticks
like arrows against the enemy. Our darts, therefore,
pierced the bodies of their pirates, while the stones
crushed them, and the lime, flying out of the broken
bottles, blinded them."</p>

<p>The Cross-bow, as we have seen, (ante, p. <a href="#Page_201">201</a>,) was
in general use throughout this century. It is figured in
our woodcuts, Nos. <a href="#i_228.jpg">49</a> and <a href="#i_232.jpg">50</a>. In both these examples
there is a provision for holding down the bow with the
foot, while the cord was drawn up to the notch. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
bow might thus be bent by the hand: but there appears
also to have been, at this early date, some apparatus
similar to the moulinet of later days, by which a stouter
bow might be easily bent by mechanical appliance. Such
a bow was called an "arbaleste Ã  tour," and the instrument
by which it was wound up was named "la clef."
No delineation of this little engine has yet been noticed
among the monuments of the time. Guiart has:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Messire Alphonse un jour ataignent,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Qui armez iert<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> de son atour,<br /></span>

<span class="i38">2<sup>e</sup>. Partie, vers 8,625.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Several further varieties of the Cross-bow are named
about this time:&mdash;BalistÃ¦ corneÃ¦; ad stapham<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>; ad

a pesarola<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>; and among the rest, a <i>Double
Cross-bow</i>, discharging two quarrels: "Balista sine nuce,
quÃ¦ duos projicit quarrellos." See Ducange and Adelung,
v. <i>Balista</i>.</p>

<p>The Quarrel (<i>carreau</i>), as its name indicates, was an
arrow with a four-sided or pyramidal head. This distinctive
form of the arbalest shaft is carefully kept in
view in the illumination from Add. MS. 15,268 (our
No. <a href="#i_228.jpg">49</a>); where, while the archer plies his barbed arrow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
the cross-bowman discharges his angular quarrel. The
feathering of the quarrel is seen very clearly in woodcut,
No. <a href="#i_232.jpg">50</a>; where the markings shew that <i>feathers</i> are
really intended, and not slices of wood, leather, or metal.
These last-named materials being found in later monuments,
it seems not unlikely that they may have been
used thus early; and we have the distinct evidence of
cotemporary writers that the <i>larger</i> quarrels discharged
from the engines called espringales were "empennÃ©s
d'airain<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>."</p>

<p>The Slings of this period have already been noticed
(page <a href="#Page_204">204</a>): the cord-sling is figured in our woodcut,
No. <a href="#i_232.jpg">50</a>, the staff-sling in No. <a href="#i_233.jpg">51</a>.</p>

<p>The Military Flail appears in the following woodcut
from Strutt's <i>Horda</i> vol. i., Plate
<span class="smcap">xxxii</span>. The original miniature
is in the MS. of Matthew Paris,
at Benet College, Cambridge,
which has already furnished us
with examples of the Staff-sling
and other weapons of this time.
The flail-man in our engraving
is engaged in the assault of a
castle: other assailants in the
same vessel are armed with bows
and slings. Adelung cites the
following passage, in which the flail is mentioned under
the name of <i>flaellum</i>: "Cum ducentis hominibus in
armis, electis et gleatis, et cum flaellis<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>."</p>

<p>The Greek Fire, still rejected among the nations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
Western Europe, for the reasons assigned in a former page,
was in frequent use among the Saracens. In 1250, the
Christians, advancing towards Damietta by water, were
intercepted by their enemies. "The Saracens in their
vessels met the Christians sailing down the river, where
a most fatal naval conflict ensued, the missiles of the
combatants flying like hail. At length, after an obstinate
battle, rendered more dreadful by the Greek fire hurled
on them by the Saracens, the Christians, being worn out
by grief and hunger, suffered a defeat<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>." The letter "to
his respected lord, Richard, earl of Cornwall," from
"John, his Chancellor," gives a similar account of this
terrible fight; from which one only of the Christians
escaped, "Alexander Giffard, an Englishman of noble
blood." "The Saracens, by throwing Greek fire on the
Christians, burnt many of their boats and killed the
people in them, thus obtaining the victory. The Christians
were drowned, slain, and burnt<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>." The authors of
the treatise, <i>Du feu grÃ©geois</i>, Captain FavÃ© and M. Reinaud,
remark that during the fifty-seven years of the
reign of French princes at Constantinople (taken in
1204), the secret of the Greek fire could not have remained
concealed from men who had made some advances
in the science of chymistry. "Mais alors les prÃ©jugÃ©s
de l'ignorance se joignaient aux idÃ©es religieuses et aux
sentimens chevaleresques, pour repousser l'emploi d'un

<p>In the East, however, the employment of incendiary
weapons was constant, and the variety of them very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
great. An Arabic treatise of this century, published in
the work named above by MM. Reinaud and FavÃ©, gives
us the most curious information relating to them, and the
interest of the manuscript is heightened by its containing
drawings (somewhat rude, it is true) of the principal instruments
and engines described. From this "Treatise
on the Art of Fighting," by Hassan Alrammah, we learn
that the Arabs of the thirteenth century employed their
incendiary compositions in four different ways: they
cast them by hand; they fixed them to staves, with
which they attacked their enemies; they poured forth
the fire through tubes; and they projected burning mixtures
of various kinds by means of arrows, javelins, and
the missiles of the great engines resembling the trebuchets
and mangonÃ¦ of their Western neighbours.
Among these fire-weapons we have&mdash;"Balles de verre;
Pots Ã  feu; La Maison de feu; Massue de guerre; Massue
pour asperger; Lance de guerre; Lance Ã  fleurs;
Lance avec massue; La lance avec la flÃ¨che du Khatay;
FlÃ¨ches en roseau; FlÃ¨ches du mangonneau; FlÃ¨ches de
la Chine; Marmite de l'Irac; Marmite de Mokharram;
Vase de Helyledjeh; Cruche de Syrie (the last
four for the mangonel); L'&#339;uf qui se meut et qui brÃ»le
(Captain FavÃ© takes this to be a projectile on the principle
of our rockets); Dard du Khatay; Des Coupes; Des
Volants; Des Lunes," &amp;c.</p>

<p>The vessels of glass and pottery, discharged by hand
or by machines, were so contrived that on striking the
object at which they were aimed, their contents spread
around, and the fire, already communicated by a fusee,
enveloped everything within its reach. A soldier on
whose head was broken a fire-mace, became suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
soaked with a diabolical fluid, which covered him from
head to foot with flame; and a flame of so terrible a nature
that it was believed to be absolutely inextinguishable.
The receipt for making the Massue de Guerre is
given with great particularity: "Tu feras faire par le
verrier une massue, &amp;c. Ensuite tu feras les mÃ©langes
usitÃ©s, &amp;c. Tu mettras le feu Ã  la massue et tu la briseras
pour le service de Dieu<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>." One of the lances is
furnished with a firework "so that the spear shall burn
the enemy, after having wounded him with its point."
Another lance "brulera bien et s' Ã©tendra Ã  plus de mille
coudÃ©es." It will be remembered that the Arabic superlative
is commonly expressed by "a thousand." What
we learn, therefore, is that this fire-missile was contrived
to wound at a distance. In applying the Massue
Ã  asperger, you are to break it against the person of
your antagonist, "but keep out of the current of the
wind, lest the sparks return upon and burn you." The
machines for casting forth the fire-pots and vases of
larger dimension bear so close a resemblance to the trebuchets
and mangonas in use by the Christian nations,
that Captain FavÃ© is inclined to think that the latter
warriors copied their engines from those of the Arabs
during the Crusades (p. <a href="#Page_49">49</a>).</p>

<p>On the second plate of the treatise are given examples
of two of the Arabian mangonels. One is formed of a
sling and weighted lever, like the instruments represented
in Roy. MS. 16, G. vi., engraved in Shaw's "Dresses and
Decorations," and on the ivory casket figured in the
fourth volume of the Journal of the ArchÃ¦ological Association.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
The other differs only in having, in lieu of a
weight, a number of cords hanging from the end of the
lever; from which it would appear that the lever was in
this case moved by men acting together by means of the
cords. Captain FavÃ© remarks that the expressions, La
flÃ¨che de la Chine, La fleur de la Chine, in shewing us
that the Chinese practised the fabrication of incendiary
agents and contributed these names to the Arabs at so
early a period, may permit us to suppose that this mode
of warfare received its chief development from them, and
even that to them may be ascribed its invention (p. <a href="#Page_44">44</a>).</p>

<p>The various <span class="smcap">Standards</span> and <span class="smcap">Flags</span> found in the last
period are continued throughout the present. But the
advancement of the science of heraldry gave to the devices
of this age a permanence which has in many cases
subsisted to the present day. The Dragon Standard was
still in use in England. At the battle of Lewes, in 1264,
between the king and his barons, "the king, being informed
of the approach of his enemies, soon set himself
in motion with his army, and went forward to meet them
with unfurled banners, preceded by the royal ensign,
which was called the Dragon<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>." In the same battle, on
the barons' side, we find the ancient Carrocium. When
the revolted nobles, with De Montford at their head,
"had reached a place scarcely two miles distant from the
town of Lewes, Simon with his friends <i>ascended an eminence</i>
and placed his Car thereon, in the midst of the
baggage and sumpter horses. There he displayed his
Standard, fastening it securely to the car, and surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
it with a great number of his soldiers<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>." The Milanese
still held their Carrocio in the utmost veneration. When
the Emperor Frederic, in 1236, crossed the Alps to
attack them, "the citizens sallied forth from the city in
great strength, to the number of about fifty thousand
armed men, and proceeded with their Standard, which
they call Carruca, or Carrochium, to meet the emperor,
sending word that they were ready to fight him<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>." In
1237 the Milanese again placed their defiant Carrocium
in front of the imperial host. They went forth with
an army of about sixty thousand men, and fixed their
Carrocium where their ranks seemed to be strongest.
At sight of this, the emperor summoned his counsellors,
and, animating them by warlike words, said: "Behold
how these insolent Milanese, our enemies, dare
to appear against us, and presume to provoke me, their
lord, to battle; enemies as they are to the truth and to
Holy Church, and borne down by the weight of their
sins. Cross the river, unfurl my Banner, my victorious
Eagle! and you, my knights, draw your formidable
swords, which you have so often steeped in the blood of
your enemies, and inflict your vengeance on these mice,
which have dared to creep out of their holes, to cope
with the glittering spears of the Roman Emperor<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>."
From the letter of the emperor himself, addressed to
"Richard, earl of Cornwall, his beloved brother-in-law,"
we learn that the Standard-Car was drawn by horses:
"quod apud Crucem-Novam (<i>Nuova Croce</i>) in equorum
celeritate prÃ¦miserant." And further on he writes:
"We now directed our attention to the attack and capture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
of this standard, and we saw that some of our troops,
having forced their way over the top of the trenches, had
penetrated almost to the mast of the Carrocium. Night,
however, coming on, we desisted from the attack till the
following morning; lying down to rest with our swords
drawn, and without taking off our iron hauberks. When
day broke, however, we found the Carrocium deserted, left
amidst a crowd of vile wagons, entirely undefended and
abandoned, and from the top of the staff where the Cross
had been, the Cross was now severed: but, being found
too heavy for the fugitives to carry off in safety, they had
left it half-way<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>."</p>

<p>The Car with its Dragon and Eagle, forming the
standard of the Emperor Otho at Bovines, has already
been noticed, (page <a href="#Page_164">164</a>). The Oriflamme of the French
monarchs maintains its illustrious position. Captured
by the Mahometans, with Saint Louis and his equipage,
it still miraculously subsists; and when destroyed by
the Flemings at the battle of Mons-en-Puelle, it is discovered
that the banner which has been torn to pieces
is, after all, only a counterfeit oriflamme, the real one
being still intact under the guardianship of the Abbot of
St. Denis. Thus Guillaume Guiart:&mdash;</p>

<p>An ordinance of Philip IV. in 1306, quoted by PÃ¨re
Daniel (Mil. Fran. j. 520), under the heading, "L'ordonnance
du Roy quant il va en Armez," directs: That
the chief Ecuyer Tranchant shall have charge of the
Royal Standard: that the chief Chamberlain shall carry
the Banner of the king: and that the chief Varlet
Tranchant shall follow close behind the king, bearing
his Pennon; and his duty is to accompany the king
wherever he may go, in order that all may know where
the monarch is stationed.</p>

<p>The knightly Banner of this time may be seen in
Roy. MS. 20, D. i.; in the Lives of the Offas (Cott.
MS., Nero, D. i.); and in many of the plates of the
Painted Chamber. In all these examples it is quadrangular,
but <i>not square</i>: its height is double its breadth.
The effigy at Minster, Isle of Sheppey, (Stothard, Pl.
<span class="smcap">xli</span>.) gives us in sculpture a large specimen of the
banner, and shews very distinctly how it was fastened
to the staff by tasselled cords.</p>

<p>The office of Bannerer of the City of London was filled
in the thirteenth century by the family of Fitz Walter,
who held the castlery of Baynard's Castle in fee for the
performance of this duty. The services and privileges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
attached to the office are laid down in a curious document
printed in Blount's "Antient Tenures," from a
MS. preserved by Dugdale. They are recorded under
two heads: the rights in time of war, and the rights in
time of peace. We give the first in full: a mere note
will suffice for the other, which are privileges rather of
a civil than a military character:&mdash;</p>

<p>"These are the rights which Robert Fitz Wauter,
Castellan of London, Lord of Wodeham, has in the city
of London: That is to say, the said Robert and his heirs
ought to be, and are, Chief Bannerers of London, by fee,
for the said Castlery, that <i>his ancestors</i> and he have of
Castle Baynard in the said City. In time of War the
said Robert and his heirs are to serve the city in manner
following. The said Robert is to come on his barded
horse (<i>sus son Destrier covert</i>), he the twentieth man-at-arms,
all with horses housed with cloth or iron (<i>coverts
de teyle ou de fer</i>), as far as the great gate of the minster
of St. Paul, with the Banner <i>of his arms</i> displayed before
him. And when he is come to the great gate of the
aforesaid minster, mounted and equipped as aforesaid,
then ought the Mayor of London, with his Sheriffs and
Aldermen (<i>ove touz ses Viscountz et ses Audermans</i>),
armed in their arms, to come out of the minster of St.
Paul as far as the said gate, with his Banner in his
hand; all being on foot. And the Banner shall be red,
having an image of St. Paul in gold, the feet, hands and
head of silver, with a silver Sword in the hand of the said
image. And as soon as the said Robert shall see the
Mayor and his Sheriffs and his Aldermen come on foot
out of the said minster, bearing this Banner, then the
said Robert, or his Heirs, who owe this service to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
said City, shall dismount from his horse, and shall salute
the Mayor as his companion and peer, and shall say to
him: 'Sir Mayor, I am come hither to fulfil the service
which I owe to the city.' Then the Mayor, Sheriffs,
and Aldermen shall say: 'We deliver to you, as the
Bannerer by fee of this City, this Banner, to bear and
govern to the honour and profit of our City, to the best
of your power.' Then the said Robert or his Heirs
shall receive the Banner. Then the Mayor of the said
City and his Sheriffs shall follow him to the gate, and
shall deliver to the said Robert a horse of the value of
twenty pounds<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>. And the horse shall have a saddle of
the arms of the said Robert<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>, and shall have a housing
of Cendal silk of the same arms; and they shall take
twenty pounds sterling, and shall deliver them to the
Chamberlain of the said Robert, for his expenses this day.
And the said Robert shall mount the horse which the
said Mayor has given to him, holding the Banner in his
hand. And as soon as he is mounted, he shall require
the Mayor to cause to be elected a Marshal out of the
troops of the City. And as soon as the Marshal is
elected, the said Robert shall direct the Mayor and
Citizens to have the Tocsin of the said city rung (<i>que
facent soner le Sein communal de la dicte Citee</i>); and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
the commonalty shall go with the Banner of St. Paul,
which the said Robert shall carry, as far as Aldgate.
Beyond that, the Banner shall be borne by one approved
of the said Robert and the Mayor. If so be (<i>si issint
soit</i>) they have to go forth out of the city, then ought
the said Robert to elect two of the most discreet persons
from each ward of the city, to provide for the safe keeping
of the city during their absence. And this council
shall be held at the Priory of the Trinity by Aldgate.
And for every town or castle that the host of London
shall besiege, the said Robert shall receive from the commonalty
of London a hundred shillings for his pains, and
no more, though the siege should last for a year. These
are the rights that the said Robert shall have in London
in time of War."</p>

<p>The rights of the Chief Bannerer in time of peace were
the possession of one of those jurisdictions called a Soke,
the power of imprisoning and punishing certain offenders
within his district, the privilege of taking part in every
"Great Council" held by the Mayor, and some others of
a similar kind. And if the culprit within his jurisdiction
has deserved death for treason, "then shall he be
tied to the post which is in the Thames at the Wood
Wharf, where boats are fastened, there to remain for two
floods and two ebbs of the tide. And if he be condemned
<i>pur commun larcin</i>, then is he to be taken to the
Elms<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>, and there undergo his punishment like other common
thieves."</p>

<p>Not less in honour than was the gold-and-silver Banner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
of Saint Paul in the south, was the Banner of Saint
John of Beverley in the north of England. It accompanied
the heroic Edward the First in his wars in Scotland;
and, besides the military bannerer, appears to have had
a clerical custodian: as we learn from this curious document
preserved in the Tower:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The triangular Pennon occurs in many of the groups
of the Painted Chamber. It is not always heraldically
charged; but this may have arisen from the partial decay
of the colours.</p>

<p>The Lance-flag, of one, of two, or of three points, may
be seen in our woodcuts, Nos. <a href="#i_264.jpg">55</a>, <a href="#i_281.jpg">62</a> and <a href="#i_330.jpg">80</a>.</p>

<p>The Horns and Trumpets used in battle are not frequently
represented in the pictures of the time; but
good examples occur in Roy. MS. 20, D. i., and on Plate
<span class="smcap">xxxvi</span>. of the Painted Chamber. The trumpets are of
two kinds, straight and slightly curved; and are figured
as of four or five feet long. The straight trumpet appears
on folio 222<sup>vo</sup>. of Roy. MS. 20, D. i.; and is borne
as a heraldic charge on the shield of Sir Roger de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
Trumpington (woodcut, No. <a href="#i_312.jpg">73</a>). The long, curved
trumpet occurs on folio 21<sup>vo</sup>. of Roy. MS. 20, D. i.
Both kinds are pictured in Plate <span class="smcap">xxxvi</span>. of the Painted
Chamber. The smaller semicircular Horn is drawn on
folio 70 of 20, D. i.</p>

<p>From the collection of medieval "Proverbes" already
cited, we learn that Spain was still the favourite mart for
the knightly <span class="smcap">charger</span>. Denmark and Brittany had also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
a celebrity for their breeds of horses of a different character.
The fiat of popular approval is given to the</p>

<p>Such was the noble nature of the high-bred dextrarius
that, when two knights had been dismounted and were
continuing the fight on foot, their horses, left to themselves,
instantly commenced a conflict of their own of the
most gallant and desperate character. A representation
of a double battle of this kind is given on folio 42 of
Roy. MS. 12, F. xiii., a treatise <i>"De natura Pecudum,
Volucrum," &amp;c.</i> The form of the Saddle of this time,
with its high pommel and cantle, may be seen in the
Royal seals engraved on Plates 52, 79, 81 and 85; and
again in the figure numbered 58. It was sometimes
heraldically decorated. In the purchases for the Windsor
Tournament<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>, in 1278, we have:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"D Felis&#834; Le Seler. viij. sell' de arm&#772; Ang&#619;. p'c&#834;. <span class="smcap">lx</span>iiij. &#619;i. P'i&#834;s.</p>

<p>On the seal of Alexander II. of Scotland, 1214&mdash;49,
the king's saddle is ensigned with a lion rampant (Cotton
Charter, xix. 2). And the seal of Robert Fitz-Walter,
1299, presents an analogous example (Plate <span class="smcap">xvii</span>. of
vol. v. of the <i>ArchÃ¦ologia</i>). The Stirrup of the period is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
shewn by numerous examples to have been triangular.
See woodcuts, No. <a href="#i_222.jpg">47</a>, <a href="#i_226.jpg">48</a> and <a href="#i_265.jpg">56</a>. The Peytrel or breastplate
was sometimes of plain fashion, as in the first seal
of Henry III. (woodcut, No. <a href="#i_326.jpg">79</a>): sometimes it had the
pendent ornaments of the preceding period, as in the
example on Plate <span class="smcap">xxxvii</span>. of the Painted Chamber, where
the pattern is a string of golden trefoils. From the
Windsor Roll quoted above we find that the poitrail was
of leather, and that this leather was occasionally gilt:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"De Stephano de Perone xi. par&#834;. strep&#834; et xi. pectoral' deaurat&#834; p'c&#834;.

<p>The Bridle presents two kinds of bits: one has the
cheeks joined by a bar from their lower end, as in woodcut,
No. <a href="#i_330.jpg">80</a>; the other has no such cross-bar (see fol. 27 of
Harl. MS. 3,244). The last quotation from the Windsor
Roll shews us that the bridles were sometimes gilt. The
group from the Painted Chamber on our woodcut, No. <a href="#i_340.jpg">82</a>,
offers a curious arrangement of the brow-band. The
rounds in the original are gold-colour.</p>

<p>The Caparison of the knightly steed appears to have
been of five kinds. 1. The horse has a "couverture" of
chain-mail only. 2. The couverture is of quilted work.
3. The housing is of a light, fluttery material, probably
covering an armour of chain-mail. 4. A light housing,
heraldically decorated, which seems to have no armour
beneath. 5. The horse has no furniture beyond the
ordinary war-saddle, peytrel and bridle.</p>

<p>Of the mailed dextrier we have already had some
notice in the preceding century (see page <a href="#Page_169">169</a>). The

<p>The trapper of chain-mail occurs on two of the plates of
that work: those numbered 31 and 37. A fragment of
a similar defence is seen on the Shurland monument at
Minster (Stothard, Pl. <span class="smcap">xli</span>.). But representations of this
kind of armament are of the greatest rarity. It is, however,
often mentioned by the writers of the time; though,
perhaps, not without some exaggeration of the numbers of
mail-clad steeds gathered in the host. At the battle of
Nuova Croce in 1237, between the imperialists and the
Milanese, Matthew Paris tells us that: "A credible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
Italian asserted that Milan with its dependencies raised an
army of six thousand men-at-arms with iron-clad horses<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>."
The <i>Chronicon Colmariense</i>, under the year 1298, describing
the force of "Australes, qui armis ferreis utebantur,"
brought against the duke of Austria, says: "Habebant
et multos qui habebant dextrarios, id est, equos magnos.
Hi equi cooperti fuerunt coopertoriis ferreis, id est, veste
ex circulis ferreis contexta." An ordinance of Philip
the Fair in 1303 provides that every holder of an estate
of 500 livres rental, shall furnish for defence of the realm
"un gentilhomme bien armÃ© et montÃ© Ã  cheval de cinquante
livres tournois et couvert de couvertures de fer
ou de couverture pourpointÃ©<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>." The particular use of the
barding of steel or pourpointerie was to defend the horses
against the missiles of the enemy. Sutcliffe's "Practice
of Arms," written in the sixteenth century, when the
musquet was rapidly supplanting the long-bow, has:
"Use of late times hath brought in divers sorts of Horsemen,
which, according to their armes and furniture, have
divers names. Some Horse are barded; others without
bardes. The French Men-of-armes, in times past, used
barded Horses, for feare of our Arrowes. Nowe, since
Archerie is not so much reckoned of, and Bardes are but
a weak defence against Shotte, Lanciers, leaving their
bardes, are armed much like to the Albanian Stradiots."</p>

<p>The pourpointed housing is named in the ordinance of
Philip IV. quoted above, and it may probably be implied
in most cases where we read of a "cheval couvert."
Rigord, under 1214, (battle of Bovines,) describes the
approach of the Imperialists on their barded horses:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
"Dixit quod viderat equos militum coopertos, ... quod
erat evidentissimum pugnÃ¦ signum." In a roll of expenses,
of 1294, given by Du Cange<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>, "Pour les
gages de Monsieur Bertran Massole, retenu aux gages
accoustumez pour lui et deux Ecuyers," we read: "Et
estoit luy et autre Ã  chevaux couverts, et un autre sans
cheval couvert:" and again: "Pour onze Ecuyers Ã 
chevaux couverts, Ã  chacun vii. sols vi. deniers par jour,
et pour deux qui n'ont point chevaux couverts, chacun v.
sols."</p>

<p>In England, the armed horse came into use between
the years 1285 and 1298; for, while the Statute of
Winchester in 1285 makes no mention of any defence
for the steed, the Statute of 27 Edw. I. in every case
requires such an armament:&mdash;</p>

<p>The housing of a lighter material seems to be presented
to us in the engravings, Nos. <a href="#i_222.jpg">47</a>, <a href="#i_310.jpg">72</a> and <a href="#i_330.jpg">80</a>. The folds
of the drapery in these examples have in no degree the
character of a stiff quilted garment. The last of the
three miniatures (from the Lives of the Offas) is further
curious from its exhibiting in the same group the horse
with and without its housing. The caparisoned steed in
front is that of King Offa the First, who leads his troops
to the defeat of the Scots. A very early example of the
trapper is found in the seal of Saer de Quinci, earl of
Winchester, 1210&mdash;19: engraved in Laing's Scottish
Seals, Plate <span class="smcap">xi</span>. In this monument, too, the housing is
armoried; which seems to shew that the heraldic and the
plain housing were introduced simultaneously. Neither
of them was at this early time a necessary concomitant
of knightly dignity; for we find no English royal seal
exhibiting the caparisoned steed till the time of Edward I.
(See woodcut, No. <a href="#i_366.jpg">85</a>.) Another early instance of the
armorial trapper is afforded by the seal of Hugo de Vere,
earl of Oxford, 1221-63<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>; and in this, as in other examples,
it will be remarked that, while the couverture
of the horse is decorated with heraldic devices, the surcoat
of the knight is altogether plain. The seal here
given, of Roger de Quinci, earl of Winchester from 1219
to 1264, has the same arrangement.</p>

<p>Other examples of the armoried housing will be found
in the Lives of the Offas, the Painted Chamber, in the
seal of Patrick, earl of March, 1292 (Laing, p. 54), in
the monument of Edmund Crouchback, 1296, (Stothard,
Pl. <span class="smcap">xliii</span>.) and in our engravings, Nos. <a href="#i_222.jpg">47</a> and <a href="#i_366.jpg">85</a>.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the thirteenth century came in the
fashion of ornamenting the head of the horse with a Fan
Crest, similar to that fixed on the helm of the knight.
This fan crest for the horse is a decoration of very high
antiquity: it appears among the Assyrian sculptures, and
again among the Lycian marbles in the British Museum.
See the engravings at page 159 and page 285 of Mr. Vaux's
able work on our national collection. The seal of Patrick
Dunbar, earl of March, 1292, affords a good example of
knight and steed decorated with the fan crest: it is
figured in Laing's Ancient Scottish Seals, page 54. In
the provision for the Windsor Tournament in 1278, crests
are furnished for every knight and every horse<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p>They were in this case made of parchment, and fastened

<p>The clavones are again mentioned in the Wardrobe Accounts
of King Edward I. in 1300<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>: "factura diversorum

was a kind of socket or cavity, but the particular arrangement
of it in fixing the crest has not been ascertained.</p>

<p>About the same time we first hear of a defence for the
horse of the nature of the later chanfrein. The same
Windsor Roll of 1278 gives us the earliest notice of
these "copita" of leather, made after the fashion (<i>de
similitudine</i>) of horses' heads:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"D Milon&#772; le Cuireur&#834;. xxxviij. copita cor&#834; de similitud' capi&#772;t equo&#541;

<p>They appear again in 1301, under the name of <i>testarÃ¦</i>
(or <i>testerÃ¦</i>) in the Indenture of Delivery of the Castle of
Montgomery to William de Leyburn (Cott. MS. Vitell.
C. x. fol. 154): "Item liberavit eidem iij. par&#834; coopertorum
ferri et ij. Testaras et v. loricas cum capite et v.
sine capite," &amp;c.</p>

<p>The thirteenth century appears to have retained all the
<span class="smcap">Engines</span> for the approach and attack of towns that were
in use during the preceding age. In this century we
first obtain pictorial evidence of the form and principle
of the mangona or trebuchet of the middle-ages, and from
this valuable testimony we learn that the motive power
of <i>torsion</i> employed during the classic period is no longer
in favour; but instead, we have a machine from which,
by means of a counterpoised beam, a large stone is cast
forth from a sling fixed at one end of the beam. We
have already (page <a href="#Page_330">330</a>) referred to the drawings of
these instruments in an Arabic manuscript of this century,
used by Captain FavÃ© and M. Reinaud in their
work, <i>Du feu grÃ©geois, &amp;c.</i> Other early representations
occur in Roy. MS. 16, G. vi., copied in Shaw's
"Dresses and Decorations;" in the ivory carving figured
in the fourth volume of the Journal of the ArchÃ¦ological
Association, and in the <i>Ã‰tudes sur l'Artillerie</i> of the Emperor
of the French, Vol. ii. Plate <span class="smcap">iii</span>. In the work of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
Gilles Colonne<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>, written for his pupil, Philip the Fair of
France, we have a distinct account of four varieties of the
trÃ©buchet: "Of pierriers," he says, "there are four kinds,
and in all these machines there is a beam which is raised
and lowered by means of a counterpoise, a sling being
attached to the end of the beam to discharge the stone.
Sometimes the counterpoise is not sufficient, and then
they attach ropes to it, in order to move the beam. The
counterpoise may either be fixed or moveable, or both at
once. In the fixed counterpoise, a box is fastened to the
end of the beam, and filled with stones or sand, or any
heavy body. These machines, anciently called <i>trabutium</i>,
cast their missiles with most exactness, because the weight
acts in a uniform manner. Their aim is so sure that one
may, so to say, hit a needle. If the gyn carries too far,
it must be drawn back or loaded with a heavier stone:
if the contrary, then it must be advanced or a smaller
stone supplied. For without attention to the weight of
the stone, one cannot hope to reach the given mark.</p>

<p>"Others of these machines have a moveable counterpoise
attached to the beam, turning upon an axis. This
variety was by the Romans named <i>biffa</i>. The third
kind, which is called <i>tripantum</i>, has two weights: one
fixed to the beam and the other moveable around it:
by this means, it throws with more exactness than the
<i>biffa</i>, and to a greater distance than the trebuchet. The
fourth sort, in lieu of weights fixed to the beam, has a
number of ropes; and is discharged by means of men
pulling simultaneously at the cords. This last kind does
not cast such large stones as the others, but it has the
advantage that it may be more rapidly loaded and discharged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
than they. In using the perriers by night, it is
necessary to attach a lighted body to the projectile: by
this means, one may discover the force of the machine,
and regulate the weight of the stone accordingly<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>."</p>

<p>The trebuchet arranged with cords is represented in
the treatise <i>Du feu grÃ©geois</i> noticed above, and in the
<i>Ã‰tudes sur l'Artillerie</i>, vol. ii. Pl. <span class="smcap">iii</span>. Those familiar
with the sights of the Thames will not fail to be struck
with the curious resemblance between this ancient engine
of warfare and the apparatus by which a gang of colliers
raise the cargo from the hold of their ships.</p>

<p>Matthew Paris mentions the plying by day and by
night of the terrible trebuchet. Under 1246, he gives
us the letter of Master Walter de Ocra, a clerk of
the Emperor, to the king of England, recounting the
events of the Italian campaign: "About eight days before
the end of last July, my Lord laid siege to the
Castle of Capaccio, in which were (certain knights)
traitors to him, and who had attempted his life, with a
hundred and fifty others, including knights, cross-bowmen,
and other friends of theirs; all of whom my said
Lord, by uninterrupted discharges of missiles, day and
night, from seven well-ordered Trebuchets, and by vigorous
and unceasing assaults, also made night and day, reduced
to such a helpless state that they could not assist
one another<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>." The castle was finally taken and destroyed,
the garrison punished by loss of eye-sight and
other mutilations; and the six leaders who had attempted
the life of the Emperor, having partaken the punishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
of their comrades, were by the imperial order "sent to
all the kings and princes throughout the various countries
of the world, with the impression of the papal bull, which
was found there, stamped on their foreheads, to give
public notice of their treachery."</p>

<p>The trebuchets were sometimes distinguished by particular
names, a fancy already begun in the "Mate-Griffon"
of C&#339;ur-de-Lion's war-tower, and afterwards
largely indulged in the great bombards of the fifteenth
and succeeding centuries. In 1303, when the Bernese
besieged Wimmis, they had two trebuchets, one of which
was named <i>La fille de bois</i>, the other <i>L'Ã‚ne</i><a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>.</p>

<p>In 1850, under the direction of the present Emperor
of the French, a trebuchet of large dimensions was constructed
after the ancient monuments, and set up at the
Ã‰cole d'Artillerie at Vincennes. A minute account of its
formation and the experiments made with it, has been
given in the Report to the Minister of War by Capt.
FavÃ©: this report is printed in the <i>Ã‰tudes sur l'Artillerie</i>,
vol. ii. page 38.</p>

<p>The projectiles thrown from the ancient trebuchets
were rounded stones, barrels of Greek fire or other incendiary
compositions, and occasionally the putrid bodies
of animals, when the siege was obstinately prolonged, or
the combatants were greatly exasperated. The rounded
stones are particularly mentioned by Guiart:&mdash;</p>

<p>The English seem to have been somewhat behindhand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
in the construction of their perriers, for Matthew Paris
tells us that in 1253 the Gascons hurled stones and darts
of such wonderful size on the army of the king, that
many of them were carried into England, to be exhibited
as curiosities<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>.</p>

<p>The mangonel was used also in sea-fights. In the
Additamenta to the <i>Historia Major</i> of Matthew Paris, we
have an account of the taking of Damietta, in which occurs
this passage: "Et lapides de <i>mangonellis navalibus</i>,
qui sic parabantur ut quinque vel sex lapides simul longo
jacerent<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>." It does not seem, however, (as it has been
suggested,) that we have here the description of an engine
which threw five or six stones at once: we must
rather understand that five or six mangonels were so
managed as to shoot in volleys.</p>

<p>Another variety of the trebuchet was the Biblia or
Bible; but its distinctive character has not been ascertained.
It is mentioned in 1238: "adducens secum
Bibliam, Petrariam et caetera bellica instrumenta<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>." And
in the <i>Roman de Claris</i>:</p>

<p>Other names occur at this time, indicating machines
for casting stones: some of these are probably mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
synonyms of the words already noticed; and of the particular
mechanism implied by others, it is vain, in the absence
of cotemporary drawings, to hope for an exact idea.</p>

<p>Besides the engines of the mangona kind, formed by
a sling and weight, there was another class constructed
on the principle of the cross-bow. The Spingarda and
Spingardella (<i>Espringale</i>) appear to have been arbalests
mounted on frames with wheels, somewhat after the
manner of the field-pieces of our own day. The French
used them against the Flemings at the battle of Mons-en-Puelle
in 1304:&mdash;</p>

<p>They shot forth, not only stones, but darts or quarrels:&mdash;</p>

<p>They were also called <i>Arbalestes Ã  tour</i>, and under this
name are included by Christine de Pisan (in the fourteenth
century) in the armament for a strong siege:
"Deux cens arbalestres, <i>trente</i> autres <i>arbalestes Ã  tour</i>, et
cent autres Ã  croc, ... douze tours tous neufs, Ã  tendre
arbalestres," &amp;c. From the last item we see very clearly
that the distinctive name of this arbalest was derived
from the instrument used to bend its powerful bow. The
figure of an espringale mounted on its carriage is given
in the <i>Ã‰tudes sur l'Artillerie</i>, vol. i. Plate <span class="smcap">i</span>.</p>

<p>The old contrivances to cover the sappers as they approached
the walls of a besieged place, still continued in
use: the Cat, the Cat-castle (<span class="smcap">chat-chastel</span>) the Vinea, and
other varieties of the mantlet occurring frequently in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
chronicles and poems of the time. The king, in the
<i>Roman de Claris</i>,</p>

<p>In 1256, the Papal troops, led by the Archbishop of
Ravenna, attack Padua, defended by the partisans of the
tyrant Eccelino; the archbishop, surrounded by a medley
of knights and monks, soldiers and priests, assaulted the
city at the gate of the Ponte Altinato: they had made
their approaches under cover of a "kind of moveable
gallery which they called <i>Vinea</i>." The defendants from
their walls poured burning pitch and boiling oil upon
the wooden vinea, so that it took fire; but the city gate
being also of wood, the besiegers pushed the machine
close to the gate, burnt it down and entered the place<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>.</p>

<p>The Moveable Towers also were still in vogue. Under
the name of <i>berfrois</i>, they are mentioned in the passage
on a preceding page from the <i>Roman de Claris</i>. Under
the year 1204 they are named by Guiart:&mdash;</p>

<p>In Roy. MS. 20, D. i., of about the close of this century,
the wooden Tower occurs in several of the miniatures.
It is constructed in the manner of a scaffolding,
having at the top an open platform filled with archers:
its height, that of the city walls, close to which it is
placed. Examples will be found on folios 305, 306 and
317. The besieged, when they were able to discover the
point to which the assaulting tower was to be moved,
loosened the soil in that spot by digging; so that, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
the ponderous machine arrived, it was overturned by its
fore-wheels sinking into the soft earth<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>. The <i>Chat-Chastel</i>
combined the <i>beffroi</i> and the <i>cattus</i>.</p>

<p>But the best account that can be offered of the Siege
operations of this time, is furnished by a cotemporary
writer, the Seneschal of Carcassone; himself the commander
of the defending forces. This very curious document
is preserved in the Archives of France, and has
been published in the <i>BibliothÃ¨que de l'Ã‰cole des Chartes</i>,
vol. vii. p. 363. Carcassone was besieged in the autumn
of 1240 by the son of the Vicomte de BÃ©ziers; and
the defender of the city, Guillaume des Ormes, sends to
Queen Blanche, regent of the kingdom during the absence
of Saint Louis, an exact account of the proceedings.
Carcassone was surrounded with a double wall, furnished
as usual with towers, and having several barbicans in
advance of its various gates. The object of the Barbican
was to afford the besieged the means of a flanking attack:
it was formed something like a street, with a wall on each
side, terminating in a kind of open tower: and it thus
became necessary that the enemy should act in the first
instance against this outwork; for, by assaulting the
curtain, they would be exposed to a flank attack from
the barbican, and might also be assailed in the rear by
sorties from the head of the work.</p>

<p>"To his most excellent and highly illustrious mistress,
Blanche, by the grace of God, Queen of the French,
William des Ormes, Seneschal of Carcassone, her humble
and devoted servant, greeting and faithful service.</p>

<p>"Madame, this is to let you know that the city of
Carcassone was besieged by him who calls himself the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
Viscount, and by his accomplices, on the Monday following
the Octave of the Nativity of the Blessed Mary<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>.
And immediately we who were within the city took from
them the suburb <i>Graveillant</i>, which is before the Toulouse
gate; and thence we obtained much timber, which was
of great use to us. The said suburb extended from the
Barbican of the city as far as the corner of the said city.
And the same day, our enemies, through the multitude
of their forces, took from us a mill. Afterwards, Olivier
de Termes, Bernard Hugon de Serre-Longue, GÃ©raud
d'Aniort, and those who were with them, lodged themselves
between the corner of the city and the water; and
there, on the same day, by means of the ditches in that
spot, and by breaking up the roads which lay between
them and us, they so fortified themselves that we could
by no means get at them.</p>

<p>"On another side, between the bridge and the Castle
Barbican, Pierre de Fenouillet and Renaud de Puy,
Guillaume Fort, Pierre de la Tour, and many others
of Carcassone, established themselves. And at both
these places they had so many Cross-bowmen<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>, that no
man could stir out of the city without being wounded.
Afterwards they set up a mangonel before our barbican,
when we lost no time in opposing to it from within an
excellent Turkish petrary<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>, which played upon the mangonel
and those about it; so that when they essayed to
cast upon us, and saw the beam of our petrary in motion,
they fled, utterly abandoning their mangonel. And in
that place they made ditches and palisades. Yet, as
often as we discharged our petrary, we drove them from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
it, still being unable to approach the spot on account of
the ditches, the pits, and the bolts from their bows(?)&mdash;<i>propter
fossata, quarellos et puteos qui ibi erant</i>.</p>

<p>"Moreover, Madame, they began to mine at the barbican
of the Narbonne gate; and we, having by listening
ascertained where they were at work, proceeded to countermine;
and we built within the barbican a strong stone
wall, so as still to retain half the barbican in surety: they
then set fire to the props of their mine, and a breach was
made in the outer part of our barbican.</p>

<p>"They also began to mine against another tower (<i>tornellam</i>)
of the outer ballium, but by countermining we
succeeded in dispossessing them of the work. Afterwards
they began (to mine) beneath another wall, and
destroyed two of our battlements (<i>cranellos de liceis</i>):
but we speedily set up a good strong palisade between
us.</p>

<p>"They mined also at the corner of the city, towards
the bishop's house, and beginning their mine from a very
great distance, they came beneath a certain Saracenic wall
(<i>murum sarraceneum</i><a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>) to the wall of the <i>ballium</i>, which,
when we perceived, we forthwith made a good strong
palisade between us and them, and countermined. Then
they set fire to the props of their mine, and brought
down about ten fathoms of our battlements. But we
speedily made a good strong palisade, on the top of
which we constructed a good <i>bretÃ¨che</i><a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>, with good loopholes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
for arrows; so that none of them dared to come
near us in this place.</p>

<p>"They began also to mine at the barbican of the <i>Porte
de Rhodez</i>, working underneath in order to reach our
wall; and in that place they formed a wonderfully large
passage. But when we perceived this, we immediately
made, on each side of their work, a great and strong
palisade; and we also countermined, and having broken
into their mine, speedily dispossessed them of it.</p>

<p>"Be it further known to you, Madame, that, from the
beginning of the siege, they have never ceased making
assaults. But we had such good store of cross-bows, and
of brave fellows determined to resist to the utmost, that
they never assaulted us but with very great loss to
themselves.</p>

<p>"At length, on a certain Sunday, they got together
all their men-at-arms, cross-bowmen, and others, and in
a body made an assault on the barbican below the castle:
but we went down into the barbican, and discharged so
many stones and quarrels against them that we forced
them to retire; many being killed or wounded. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
following Sunday, after the Feast of St. Michael, they
made a very fierce assault. But we, thanks to the brave
defence of our men, repulsed them, killing and wounding
many: on our side, not one was either slain or mortally
wounded.</p>

<p>"The day after, towards the evening, hearing, Madame,
that your troops were approaching to relieve us, the
enemy set fire to the suburb of Carcassone. They have
entirely destroyed the buildings of the Friars Minor,
and those of the monastery of the Blessed Mary, in the
suburb, using the timber from them to construct their
palisades. But at night all the besiegers furtively withdrew;
and, with them, those of the suburb.</p>

<p>"In sooth, Madame, we were well prepared to hold
out much longer; for, during the whole siege, not one
of your people, however poor his estate, ever suffered for
want of food; and we had corn and meat enough for a
much more obstinate resistance, if need had been. Be
it known to you, Madame, that these evil-doers, on the
second day of their coming, slew thirty-three priests and
other holy men whom they met on entering the suburb.
Know also, Madame, that the Seigneur P. de Voisin,
your Constable of Carcassone, R. de Capendu, and Gerard
d'Ermenville, have greatly distinguished themselves in
this affair. But the Constable, by his vigilance, his
bravery and his daring, is entitled to the chief praise of
all. On other matters concerning the district, we can
better render a faithful account, Madame, when we shall
be in your presence. In a word, they began mines
against us in seven different places: but we in most
cases countermined them, and offered a stout opposition.
They commenced their mines at their own quarters, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
that we knew nothing of their approach till they were
near our walls.</p>

<p>"Given at Carcassone, 13 Oct. 1240.</p>

<p>"Know, Madame, that the enemy burned the castles
and towns which they passed in their flight."</p>

<p>The town of Carcassone in its present state is probably
the most perfect fortification of the middle ages
in existence. The whole of the walls, towers, barbicans,
ditches, and even the drawbridges, are still in being,
and wonderfully little injured, considering that they date
from the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Enough
remains to restore the whole perfectly, without doubt or
hesitation. An admirable series of plans and drawings
of these interesting fortifications has been made by M.
Viollet-Le-Duc for the French Government, shewing
every part in its actual state, and an equally complete
series of designs for their restoration, representing them
exactly as they appeared at the siege so well described
by the Seneschal. The accounts relating to the building
of these walls and the preparations for their defence, are
preserved in the French archives. The very valuable and
interesting series of drawings named above was exhibited
by the French government in the Architectural Gallery
of the <i>Exposition des Beaux Arts</i> in 1855, and a great
part of them are beautifully engraved on a reduced scale
in the "Essai sur l'Architecture Militaire du Moyen-Age,"
already noticed. In these plans the situation of
the castle on one side of the town, and of the different
barbicans as described by the Seneschal, are very clearly
marked. There are a few barbicans remaining perfect in
England, as at Warwick and Alnwick.</p>

<p>The siege of Bedford Castle in 1224 affords another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
good example of the mode of attacking a stronghold at
this period. The garrison in this instance were rebels to
the king; their leader, one Fawkes, a foreigner, a partisan
of the Bishop of Winchester; though not himself present
at the time of the siege. The castle was invested by the
king himself. Two lofty towers of wood, of the kind
already described, were raised by the walls and filled
with archers. Seven mangonÃ¦ cast forth ponderous
stones from morning till night. Sappers approached the
walls under cover of the Cat. First, the barbican, then
the outer ballium, was taken. A breach in the second
wall soon after gave the besiegers admission to the inner
bailey. The donjon still held out, and the royalists proceeded
to attack it by means of their sappers. A sufficient
portion of the foundations having been removed,
the stanchions were set on fire, one of the angles sank
deep into the ground, and a wide rent laid open the interior
of the keep. The garrison now planted the royal
standard on the tower, and sent the women to implore
mercy. But a severe example was required, in order to
strike terror among the disaffected in other quarters of
the realm. The knights and others, therefore, to the
number of eighty, were hanged; the archers were sent
into Palestine, to redeem their fault by fighting against
the enemies of the faith; while their leader, Fawkes,
who now surrendered himself at Coventry, was banished
from the island<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>.</p>

<p>Matthew Paris records the existence of a singular and
somewhat poetical Monument of Victory, left to celebrate
the capture of a castle in the Campagna of Rome. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
emperor "had taken a castle near Montfort, belonging to
the nephews and other relatives of the pope, which he,
the pope, had newly built with the money of the Crusaders.
The emperor destroyed the fortress, hanged all
whom he found therein, and in token of the destruction
of it, left a sort of <i>tower half-destroyed</i>, that the memory
of the offence, as well as of his vengeance, might never
die<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sea-fights</span> were still achieved by the same knights,
men-at-arms, archers and "satellites," as contended in
land warfare. A good pictorial example of a naval battle
of this time occurs on folio 357 of Roy. MS. 20, D. i.
See also fol. 23<sup>vo</sup> of the same MS., for the picture of an
armed fleet. Further examples of a similar kind will be
found in this very curious volume, as well as of Tents
and many other objects of military use.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tournaments</span> continued to enjoy a large amount of
favour among the nobles and knights, and their retainers:
but princes began to see that these great armed meetings
of their powerful vassals, in the facilities they afforded for
combinations against the royal power, and in the imposing
exhibition of the baronial force and dignity necessarily
involved in these pageants, were full of danger to the
kingly order; and, in consequence, forbade their celebration
except under express permission of the sovereign<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>.
The plea was, the dangers incurred by the competitors at
these mock battles, and the disorders to which they sometimes
led. And indeed it was not difficult to justify the
prohibition on these grounds. Among many instances
that might be quoted of the tumultuous termination of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
tournament, we may notice that of Rochester in 1251.
"In this same year," says Paris<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>, "on the Feast of
the Conception of the Blessed Virgin, a fierce Tournament
was held at Rochester between the English and
foreigners, in which the foreigners were so shamefully
beaten that they disgracefully fled to the city for refuge;
but, being met by knights coming in an opposite
direction, they were again attacked, despoiled, and
soundly beaten with sticks and staves: and thus they
returned with much interest the blows and injuries they
had received at the tournament of Brackley. The anger
and hatred between the English and foreigners increased
in consequence, and became daily more fearful." Another
striking example of this century is the hastilude between
King Edward I. and the Count of ChÃ¢lons in 1274, which
was of so serious a nature as to receive the name of "La
petite Bataille de ChÃ¢lons." The king, returning from
the Holy Land, to take possession of his crown, was invited
by the Count to participate in a tourney which he
was preparing. The king's company is said to have been
a thousand only, while those engaged on the Count's side
are estimated at double the number. But this is the
estimate of English chroniclers. The tourneyers met
near ChÃ¢lons, some on horseback, others on foot, armed
with swords. The Count, who was a very powerful man,
singled out the king for an antagonist; cast aside his
sword, threw his arms round the neck of the monarch,
and used all his force to drag him from his horse. But
the king, taking advantage of the tight hold by which
the Count had fixed himself to his person, and relying
on his own strength, suddenly clapped spurs to his horse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
carried away the Count out of his saddle, and then by a
violent shake tumbled him to the ground. Being remounted,
the Count renewed the attack, but with no
greater success than before. His knights, meanwhile,
exasperated at the discomfiture of their leader, began to
assail the English with all the rancour of real warfare.
The English returned wound for wound: the "Joust of
Peace" became a "JoÃ»te Ã  outrance:" Edward's archers
plied their terrible arrows, routed the troops opposed to
them, rushed upon the knights, slew their steeds or cut
their saddle-girths, so as to bring to the ground many a
sturdy baron and rich prisoner<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>.</p>

<p>Of the mandates issued for the suppression of tournaments,
many examples have come down to us. The F&#339;dera
contains a considerable number. Some were sent forth
by the temporal prince, others were launched by the spiritual
arm; for it was no difficult matter in these days to
obtain the pope's aid in any scheme of this nature, where
a benevolent intention could be assigned, and a liberal
douceur had been supplied. In 1220, Pandulf the legate
forbids a tournament in England, under pain of the forfeiture
of goods and of excommunication<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>. In 1234, the
king of England charges his subjects that they offend not
by tourneying or behourding (<i>buhurdare vel torneare</i><a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>).
In 1255 the royal inhibition is again sent forth, and the
reason given for its publication is the peril of Prince
Edward in Gascony: "eo quod Edwardus, filius Regis
in gravi periculo existit in Wasconia<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>." 1265 is the
date of another<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>. In 1299, the king again issues his
mandate: this time with penalties of peculiar severity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
The knight is forbidden "sub forisfacturÃ¢ vite et membrorum,
et omnium que tenet in dicto regno, torneare,
bordeare, seu justas facere, aventuras querere, aut aliÃ s
ad arma ire, quoquo modo, sine nostrÃ¢ licenciÃ¢ speciali."
Should any dare to disobey, then they are forthwith to be
arrested and placed in safe custody, "corpora ipsorum,
unÃ  cum equis et hernesio suis<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>."</p>

<p>Whilst, however, the monarch of timid character and
jealous of his baronage, looked with disrelish on the
Tournament, the prince of an enterprising disposition
and skilled in military exercises, naturally regarded with
more complacency a pastime in which his own achievements
were placed in the most brilliant light, and the
respect and attachment of his nobles secured, by the
exhibition of those qualities on which they themselves
founded their chief claim to power and distinction. Thus,
in the thirteenth century, when the king (Henry III.)
had created eighty new knights, the gallant Prince Edward
accompanied them to a tournament which had been
proclaimed on the continent, "that each might try his
strength, as was the custom with newly-made knights<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>."
In 1253, the Earl of Gloucester with a companion also
went abroad, to take part in a marriage festivity and in
a tournament which followed it: an adventure in which
they were so roughly handled by the antagonist knights
as to require daily fomentations and bathing to restore
them to health<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>.</p>

<p>Regarding the equipment of the knights and their assistants
at the Tournament, there are two documents of
this century which are of the highest interest and afford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
the most curious information. These are the "Statutum
Armorum ad Torniamenta," compiled previous to 1295;
and the roll detailing the "Empciones facte contra Torniamentum
de Parco de Windsore," in the 6th year of
Edward I.; from the latter of which we have already
extracted some passages illustrative of various portions
of the knightly armament.</p>

<p>By the tournament statute we learn that there existed
at this time a sort of Court of Honour, to judge all disputes
and delinquencies that might arise during the celebration
of the games; and the members of it were the
king's eldest son, Prince Edward; Edmund, earl of Lancaster;
William de Valence, earl of Pembroke; Gilbert
de Clare, earl of Gloucester; and the earl of Lincoln.
As De Valence, the last of his name, died in 1296, and
the earl of Gloucester in 1295, the date of this document
cannot of course be later than the year last quoted<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>. It
is not unworthy of note that the effigies of two of these
Judges of the Tournament, fully equipped in the trappings
of armed knighthood, have been preserved to our
days: the monuments of Edmund Crouchback and of
William de Valence in Westminster Abbey are among
the most curious memorials that can be consulted by the
student of ancient military costume. There are several
copies of the statute extant. The following, from a
manuscript in the Bodleian Library, has been selected
by the Record Commission as the most trustworthy<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p>This document affords us some curious glimpses at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
customs of the time; not less by what it forbids than by
what it ordains. A tournament in which the combatants
are liable to be pelted by the stones and slings of the
varlets and other lookers-on, does not give us a very
exalted idea of these festivals; and, for a holiday game,
the rules seem oddly severe which decree that the poor
squire who infringes them shall lose horse and armour,
and "demeorge iij. aunz en la prison."</p>

<p>The Roll of Purchases made for the Tournament of
Windsor Park, "per manum Adinetti <i>cissoris</i>," is preserved
in the Tower of London, and bears date 9th of
July in the sixth year of Edward I. (1278). The jousts
were of the kind called "Jousts of Peace," and the
knights for whom armour is provided are thirty-eight in
number. Of these, twelve are styled "digniores," and
wore gilded helms, while the remainder had head-pieces
that were silvered only. A "memorandum" informs us
that each suit consisted of one coat-of-fence, one surcoat,
one pair of ailettes, two crests (of which, one for the
horse), one shield, one helm of leather, and one sword
made of whalebone. "M<sup>d</sup> q&#273; in quo &#817;p h&#834;ne&#834;s fu'unt j.
Tunic' ar&#834;m: j. coo&#817;ptor&#834;: j. par&#834; alett&#834;. Itm&#772; ij. Crest&#834; &amp; j.
Blazon&#772; &amp; una galea cor&#834; &amp; j. ensis de Balon&#772;." Each coat-of-fence
was composed of a Cuirass and Arm-defences.
The cuirasses (<i>quirettÃ¦</i>) being supplied by "Milo the
Currier," were probably of leather, as the helms were:
"De Milon&#772; le Cuireur&#834;. xxxviij. quiret&#834;: p'&#772;c pe&#772;c iij. s."
For each of them were furnished two ells of the cloth
called "Carda;" while eight pieces of "Diaper" contributed
to the formation of the whole thirty-eight:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Pro qualibet quirett&#834; ij. uln&#772; card.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Pro eisd' h&#834;ne&#834;s armand' viij. diasper&#834;."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The carda is charged at fourpence an ell; the diaper at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
eight shillings the piece. "Ten buckrams" are supplied
to form the arm-defences: "Item &#817;p xxxviij. par&#834; brach&#834;
x. bukerann&#772;." And the whole of these are painted:
"Item &#817;p f&#772;cur&#834; &amp; pictur&#834; xxxviij. par&#834; Brach' de Bokeran
p'&#772;c par&#834; iiij. d." These body-armours must have differed
very widely in their structure or embellishment; for
while the Harness-of-Arms of Walter de Sancto Martino
only cost seven shillings, that of the Earl of Lincoln
amounted to thirty-three shillings and fourpence. Little
bells were added to the equipment either of the knights
or their horses; perhaps both: and they were purchased
of Richard Paternoster: "De Ric&#333; pat'nr&#834; <span class="smcap">dccc</span>. Nola&#541;
sive Tintunabul' p'&#772;c cent&#834;. iij. s." This decoration of
bells obtained great favour in the next two centuries.</p>

<p>The surcoats of the four earls<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> were of Cindon silk,
the remaining thirty-four of Carda: "Pro iiij. coo&#817;ptor&#834;
&#817;p iiij<sup>or</sup> Comit&#834; ij. Cind' &amp; d&#299;. Item &#817;p xxxiiij. coo&#817;ptor&#834;.
<span class="smcap">cxix</span>. uln&#772;. card." The ailettes were made of leather and
carda, being fastened by laces of silk: "D. Milon&#772; le
Cuireur&#834;. xxxviij. par&#834; alett&#834; cor&#834; p'&#772;c par&#834; viiij. d.... Item
pro xxxviij. par&#834; alett&#834; xix. uln&#772;. card.... viij. Duoden&#772;
laqueo&#541; seri&#772;c &#817;p alett&#834; p'&#772;c duoden&#772; viij. d." Each helm
and each horse had a crest, which was made of calf-skin,
and fastened by the <i>chastones</i> and <i>clavones</i> already noticed
at page <a href="#Page_347">347</a>. Stephen the Joiner supplied thirty-eight
shields of wood at fivepence each: "De Steph&#333; Junctor&#834;
xxxviij. scut&#834; fustin&#772; p'&#772;c scuti. v. d." Being elsewhere
called <i>blazonÃ¦</i>, we may conclude they were heraldically
ensigned. The helms were of leather, supplied by
Robert Erunnler in their crude state at sixteenpence per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
helm; but afterwards embellished by Ralph de la Haye,
who gilt twelve of them with pure gold for the chief
knights at a shilling apiece, and silvered the remainder
at eightpence each: "De Rob'o Erunnler xxxviij. galee
de cor&#834; p'&#772;c galee xvj. d. Item Ra&#273;o de la Haye &#817;p Batur&#834;

Eidem pro Batur&#834; xxvi. gal' de argento, p'&#772;c gal' viij. d."
The swords were made of whalebone and parchment,
their blades silvered, the hilt and pommel gilt: "De
Petro le Furbeur&#834; (the furbisher) xxxviii. glad' fact&#834; de
Balen&#772; &amp; Parcomen&#772;, p'&#772;c pe&#772;c vij. d. Itm&#772; &#817;p Batur&#834; d&#772;co&#541;

<p>The sum-total paid for these thirty-eight equipments,
including their carriage from London to Windsor, was
Â£80 11<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> Other purchases were made at Paris, of
which a portion appears to have been for the tournament,
as the horse furniture, already noticed at page <a href="#Page_340">340</a>.
Other articles are of a miscellaneous character, as hawking-gloves,
furs for mantles, carpets, and "a hundred
<i>fromages de Brie</i> for the King and Queen" (<span class="smcap">c</span>. casei de
Bria pro Rege et Regina, precium xxxv. s.). The whole
of the document, however, deserves a careful investigation,
though we have extracted the chief particulars
which illustrate the subject of our inquiry. It is printed
in full in the seventeenth volume of the <i>ArchÃ¦ologia</i>.</p>

<p>There was a variety of the tournament in vogue during
this century, called the Round Table; of which, though
some curious details have been preserved, the particular
characteristic has not been ascertained. Matthew Paris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>
has noted with especial distinctness that the <i>Tabula
rotunda</i> was not a mere new name given to an old sport,
but that it was a pastime of a different kind. "In this
year, 1252, he says, the knights of England, in order to
prove their skill and bravery in military practices, unanimously
determined to try their powers, not in the sport
commonly and vulgarly called a Tournament, but in that
military game which is named The Round Table: (non
ut in hastiludio illo quod communiter et vulgariter Torneamentum
dicitur, sed potiÃ¹s in illo ludo militari qui
Mensa Rotunda dicitur:) therefore, at the Octave of the
Nativity of the Blessed Virgin, they assembled in great
numbers at the Abbey of Wallenden, flocking together
from the north and from the south, and some also from
the continent. And, according to the rules of that warlike
sport, on that day and the day following, some English
knights disported themselves with great skill and
valour, to the pleasure and admiration of all the foreigners
there present. On the fourth day following,
two knights of great valour and renown, Arnold de Montigny
and Roger de Lemburn, came forth completely
armed after the manner of knights, and mounted on
choice and handsome horses. And, as they rushed onward
to encounter with their lances, Roger aimed his
weapon, the point of which was not blunted, as it ought
to have been, so that it entered under the helm of Arnold,
and pierced his throat: for he was unarmed in that part
of his body, being without a collar (<i>carens collario</i>)."
Montigny expired on the spot, and the festivities were
turned to mourning; so that "those who had come thither
in joy and gladness, separated on a sudden amid grief
and lamentation; De Lemburn at once making a vow to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
assume the Cross and undertake a pilgrimage for the release
of the soul of Arnold."</p>

<p>From this relation we learn that the knights, fully
armed, contended with lances on horseback, and that it
was an especial rule of the combat that the lance-heads
should be blunt or "rebated."</p>

<p>In 1280, the eighth of Edward I., earl Roger de Mortimer
held a Round Table at his Castle of Kenilworth.
"It was," says Dugdale, "a great and famous concourse
of noble persons called the <i>Round Table</i>, consisting of an
hundred Knights and as many Ladies, whereunto divers
repaired from foreign parts for the exercise of Arms,
viz., Tilting and martial Tournaments: the reason of the
<i>Round Table</i> being to avoyd contention touching precedency;
a Custome of great antiquity, and used by the
antient <i>Gauls</i>, as Mr. <i>Cambden</i> in <i>Hantsh.</i> from <i>AthenÃ¦us</i>
(an approved Author) observes." The original authorities
for this description of the Kenilworth Round-Table festival
are Trivet and Walsingham, and the passages may be
seen either in their histories, <i>ad an.</i> 1280, or in Ducange,
<i>sub voce</i> Tabula Rotunda. Dugdale seems to have had
the notion that, to avoid disputes about precedency, all
the jousters dined together at the Round Table; but it
must have been a large table to have accommodated "an
hundred Knights,"&mdash;to say nothing of the hundred Ladies.
It seems more probable, comparing this institution with
others of an analogous character, that a certain number
of knights, representing (and perhaps assuming the names
of) King Arthur and his far-famed band of warriors, held
the field "against all comers." This view receives some
support from the well-known relic at Winchester, "the
rownde table of Kyng Arthur and hys Knyghtes," which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
is painted in compartments, each bearing the name of one
of the fraternity. The table in question is not, indeed,
more ancient than about the beginning of the sixteenth
century; but, as the Hall at Winchester in which it is
preserved is of the thirteenth century (the very period
in which the sport of the <i>Tabula Rotunda</i> came into
vogue), it seems likely that this table represents some
more ancient one which time has destroyed. The existing
"King Arthur's Round Table" is figured in the Winchester
volume of the ArchÃ¦ological Institute; and in
the notice of it in that volume is cited a curious passage
from Leroux de Lincy (himself quoting Diego de Vera,
who was present at the marriage of Philip and Mary),
by which it appears that tradition had assigned to a particular
compartment the name of "the place of Judas or
the perilous seat:" "Lors du mariage de Philippe II.
avec la reine Marie, on montroit encore Ã  Hunscrit<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> la
table ronde fabriquÃ©e par Merlin: elle se composoit de
25 compartimens en blanc et en vert: dans chaque division
Ã©toient Ã©crits le nom du cavalier et celui du roi.
L'un de ces compartimens, appelÃ© <i>Place de Judas</i> ou
<i>SiÃ©ge pÃ©rilleux</i>, restoit toujours vide." Judas appears to
have been interpolated from one of the Mystery Plays of
the Middle-Ages, and it must be confessed that a table
"made by Merlin" and surrounded by King Arthur and
his knights, with Judas for a boon-companion, has in it
a certain boldness of concatenation which might well
strike with awe the solemn mind of Don Diego de Vera,
on the occasion of his visit to Hunscrit. A passage in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
the <i>Faits de Bouciquaut</i> seems to imply that holding a
Round Table meant a hastilude in which the challengers
kept open house: "Ainsi fit lÃ  son appareil moult
grandement et trÃ¨s honnorablement Messire Bouciquaut,
et fit faire provisions de trÃ¨s bons vins, et de tous vivres
largement et' Ã  plain, et de tout ce qu'il convient, si
plantureusement <i>comme pour tenir table ronde Ã  tous venans</i>
tout le dict temps durant, et tout aux propres despens
de Bouciquaut<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>."</p>

<p>If the nobles of the land retained their fondness for the
military pastimes of their order, the commonalty were
not less attached to the cognate sports of their class. Indeed,
their enthusiasm sometimes led them to an excess
of ambition which resulted in an armed contest between
the two bodies of knight and craftsman: they dared to
practise the exercise of the quintain for the prize of a
peacock! the peacock, that noble bird, every feather in
whose tail was an eye of disdain contumeliously glowering
upon the whole generation of plebeians.</p>

<p>The inexhaustible Matthew Paris again furnishes us
with an illustration:&mdash;"In the first fortnight of Lent
(1253), the young men of London tested their own powers
and the speed of their horses in the sport which is commonly
called the Quintain, having fixed on a Peacock as
the prize of the contest. Some attendants and pages of
the king's household (he being then at Westminster) were
indignant at this, and insulted the citizens, calling them
rustics, scurvy and soapy wretches, and at once entered
the field to oppose them. The Londoners eagerly accepted
their challenge, and, after beating their backs with the
broken spear-shafts till they were black and blue, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
hurled all the royal attendants from their horses or put
them to flight. The fugitives then went to the king and
with clasped hands and gushing tears besought him not
to let so great an offence go unpunished; and he, resorting
to his usual kind of vengeance, extorted from the
citizens a large sum of money."</p>

<p>Figures of the quintain and the tilters may be seen in
Strutt's Sports: the manuscripts he has used are of a
somewhat later date, (that is, fourteenth century,) but the
forms of the quintains may be fairly taken as similar to
those of the preceding age.</p>

<p>In the thirteenth century we first obtain a pictorial
representation of the <span class="smcap">Legal Duel</span>, or wager of battle:
rude, it is true, but curiously confirming the written
testimony that has come down to us of the arms and
apparel of the Champions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

<p>This drawing has been carefully traced from one of the
"Miscellaneous Rolls" in the Tower, of the time of Henry
III. The combatants are Walter Blowberme and Hamun
le Stare, the latter being the vanquished champion, and
figuring a second time in the group as undergoing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
punishment incidental to his defeat. The names of the
duellers are written over the figures, the central one
being that of the victor. Both are armed with the quadrangular
bowed shield and a "baston" headed with a
double beak. Britton (De Jure AngliÃ¦, fol. 41) exactly
describes their arming: "Puis voisent combattre armÃ©s
sans fer et sans longe arme, Ã  testes dÃ©couvertes et Ã 
mains nues (Ã  piÃ©?) ovesque deux bastons cornuts d'une
longueur, et chascun de eux d'un escu de quatre corners,
sauns autre arme dont nul ne puisse autre griever." The
exact length of the bÃ¢tons we learn from a statute of
Philip of France in 1215: "Statuimus quod Campiones
non pugnent de caetero cum baculis qui excedant longitudinem
trium pedum." They might, however, continues
the statute, use staves of shorter dimensions, if
they thought proper.</p>

<p>The arming "sans fer" mentioned above is made more
clear by a passage of the "Coustumier of Normandy," chap.
28: (Les champions doivent Ãªtre) "appareillez en leurs
cuiries, ou en leurs cotes, avec leurs escus, et leurs bastons
cornus, armez si comme mestier sera de drap, de
cuir, de laine et d'estoupes. Es escus, ne es bastons, ne
es armures de jambes, ne doit aver fors fust ou cuir, ou
ci qui est pardevant dit; ne ils ne peuvent avoir autre
instrument Ã  grever l'un l'autre fors l'escu et le baston."
The bare heads and cropped hair of our duellers are in
conformity with another ordinance of the Camp-fight:
"Les Chevaliers qui se combate por murtre ou por homicide,
se doive combatre Ã  piÃ©, et <i>sans coiffe</i>, et estre
<i>roignÃ©s Ã  la reonde</i><a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>." Compare the figure of the champion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
of Bishop Wyvil, which appears on the monumental
brass of the prelate in Salisbury Cathedral: date 1375.
It is engraved in Waller's Brasses, Part ix., and in Carter's
"Painting and Sculpture." For an extended series
of evidences relating to the custom of Wager of Battle,
see Ducange or Adelung, <i>v. Campiones</i>, and compare
Henault, <i>ad an.</i> 1260.</p>

sculptured figures has been finely engraved
in Stothard's Monumental Effigies,
and in the continuation of this
work by the brothers Hollis. The continental
examples, especially those of Germany,
are ably figured in Hefner's <i>Costumes
du Moyen-Age</i>. The sculptured
effigies preserved in the Church of St.
Denis are well described in the <i>Monographie de l'Eglise de St. Denis</i> of the
Baron De Guilhermy. The monumental
brasses of England have been engraved
excellently and in large numbers by
Messrs. Waller, and in the subsequent
works of the Rev. Mr. Boutell. The
knightly statues given in Blore's Monuments,
though not numerous, are of the
highest order of art, and perfect in their
truthfulness.</p></div>

Newton Solney in Derbyshire, the monument
here figured. See ArchÃ¦ol. Journ.,

made between 1298 and 1304, as it contains
also a shield of the arms of Ferrers;

<p><a name="Footnote_421_421" id="Footnote_421_421"></a><a href="#FNanchor_421_421"><span class="label">[421]</span></a> A BretÃ¨che was a covered passage
constructed of wood on the top of a wall
or of a tower, carried upon the series of
corbels called machicoulis. It was usually
removed in time of peace, being easily
put up again in time of war: for this
reason, examples are not often now to
be found. There are probably none remaining in England, and they are rare
in France, but occasionally occur in a
dilapidated state, and the marks where
they have been placed are to be seen
on almost every old fortification. They
formed a very important part of the
defensive system in the middle ages. It
was in these wooden galleries that the
archers were chiefly placed, and from them
stones were hurled on the heads of the
assailants through the openings of the
machicoulis, the men being entirely protected
by the outer boarding and roof of
the bretÃ¨che or gallery. (For many engravings
of them, see Viollet-Le-Duc,
Architecture Militaire du Moyen-Age,
8vo. Paris, 1854.) There were loopholes
in the outer boarding; and in the wall
behind openings for the supply of projectiles
from the inner passage behind
the parapet wall, in front of which the
<i>bretÃ¨ches</i> were built. These projectiles
were conveyed to the top of the walls or
towers by means of the sort of wells
which we find in the thickness of the
walls of old castles. The <i>BretÃ¨ches</i> were
also called <i>Hourds</i>. They were sometimes
erected on the top of wooden palisades
only, as was the case in this instance.</p></div>
